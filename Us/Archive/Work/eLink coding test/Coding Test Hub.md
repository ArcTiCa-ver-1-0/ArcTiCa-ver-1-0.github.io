- [[README]]
	- Okay! Where to start?
		- Let's look at [[README]] .>>
			- I suppose the best thing to do would be to get the home page loaded.
				- Let's try `npm run dev` .>>
					- That yields ![[npm run dev|this]]
						- The first local link pulls up this page: ![[Pasted image 20240612163539.png|this page]]
						- It says to access the application I'll need to run a local dev server, and then gives the options of [Artisan Serve](https://laravel.com/docs/installation#your-first-laravel-project) and [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/sail). I suppose these are means to running said dev server.
							- I'll need an internet connection to open those links, so let's backtrack for now. .<<
					- The second link gives nothing.
			- Let's look at the controllers .>>
				- In `./app/Http/Controllers/`, we have:
					- `Controller.php`
						- Let's start by looking at this one .>>
							- Seems to be standard boilerplate, perhaps a namespace or the like .<<
					- ==`CartController.php`==
						- I'll look at this one next, since it's presumably the one we will be modifying, or the one closest to what we will be modifying .>>
							- Indeed, there are a few function outlines with empty comments as their only contents. The methods are for storing, updating, and destroying resources .<<
					- ==`HomeController.php`==
						- Might as well look at this next .>>
							- Seems to be some rendering code. This ==_might_== be relevant, since the task description mentions a need for the item count to persist through refresh.
					- `ProfileController.php`
						- And lastly, let's look at this one .>>
							- Some stuff related to user accounts. Probably not relevant to this project .<<
					- ...and another directory `./Auth/`
						- Let's take a peek inside .>>
							- Lots of stuff related to sessions and verification. Probably not too relevant .<<
				- In `./app/Models/`, we have:
					- ==`Product.php`==, as mentioned
						- Let's look inside .>>
							- Seems to be a container for line items...? It's a class definition, more or less .<<
					- ==`LineItem.php`==, as mentioned
						- Let's have a look .>>
							- More class definition, tying back to products via their ID .<<
					- and `User.php`, which was not mentioned.
						- Might as well have a peek .>>
							- Some misc login-related things. Probably not important to me .<<
				- I'll do a quick search to make sure I didn't miss any .>>
					- Based on the matching names, it seems like we found all of the relevant ones .<<
			- Let's look at the frontend components in `./resources/js/ .>>
				- The named components are:
					- `./Pages/Home.vue`
						- Let's read this one .>>
							- This HTML-like stuff is hard to read, but this does indeed seem to be for loading a ==homepage== .<<
					- ==`./Components/Catalog/CartPopup.vue`==
						- Let's look .>>
							- A smaller file, notably with some text reading "No items are in your cart." .<<
					- and ==`./Components/Catalog/ProductCard.vue`==
						- Have a look .>>
							- Has some references like `product.name` and `product.color` .<<
			- Finally, let's look at the cart store in ==`./resources/js/stores/cart.ts`== .>>
				- A short file with a seemingly incomplete function .<<
		- So, what we are actually doing is implementing an "add to cart" button for products on the homepage.
			- The button will probably send some request containing information on the item which it is associated with to the user's cart (which is not an entity in this challenge).
			- I'm not sure where the difference between a product and a line item comes into play; perhaps the product is the abstract and the line item is the actual thing.
- So! First thing to do is debug this:
	- Products is not an array: Proxy { \<target\>: {…}, \<handler\>: {…} } | Home.vue:50:13 
		- Products should, in fact, be an array. Let's fix that!
