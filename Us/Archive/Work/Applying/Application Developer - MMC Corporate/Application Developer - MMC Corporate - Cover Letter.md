Hiring manager at Marsh McLennan
Louisville, KY

Hello,

I am writing to express my interest in the Application Developer position at MMC. I am an upcoming graduate from the University of Kentucky majoring in computer science with a minor in mathematics. I am very excited for the opportunity to take on application development with your company with its modern approach to hybrid work and strong profile of software.

During my academic career, my focus has been on developing AI and machine learning systems in order to stay up-to-date with the changing world. As such, I am able to pick up and adapt to new systems and structures very quickly, and with the university's focus on real-world experience, I am knowledgeable and practiced in working with small to middling teams in many project management methodologies. I pride myself on my ability to write efficient, scalable, and performant code while putting correctness and customer satisfaction first.

I believe that this role would be an invaluable piece of experience for my future career, and the opportunity to be a part of this team would undoubtedly teach me new skills to keep under my belt. I very much am looking forward to the opportunity to be a part of making the excellent code behind this business.

Thank you for your consideration in taking me on for this role.

Taylor Brannon
