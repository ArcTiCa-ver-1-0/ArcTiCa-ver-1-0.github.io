Hello,

I am writing to express my interest in the Student Research Assistant position at the University of Kentucky. I am a CS major with a minor in Mathematics, though my pursuit of this degree has been put on hold due to medical issues. If being an active student is a requirement for this position, please feel free to stop reading.

My focus during my academic career at the university has been on AI and machine learning; I've taken every course available to me on the topics and have made sure to back up my practical knowledge with strong theory and mathematical ability. They are my passion and I pride myself on my ability to deliver optimized, performant, and correct code. As such, I believe I have the care necessary to take on such an important role.

This position interests me because it is an opportunity to use the skills I have acquired to make a real positive impact on the world in a way which suits me. The engineering track at the university has prepared me for presenting my learning in a professional manner, and I consider my time management skills to be among the best.

Thank you for your consideration in taking me on for this role.

Taylor Brannon
