Dear Cindy Zimmermann,

I am excited to apply for the high school math teacher position at KORE Academy. As someone with ADHD and autism, I deeply understand the importance of inclusive and personalized instruction. KORE Academy's mission of providing a safe and individualized learning environment for all students truly resonates with me, and I believe that my skills and focus on mathematics uniquely position me to make a positive impact on my community.

During my academic career at the University of Kentucky, I gathered teaching experience as an assistant in the computer science department. My primary role to provide after-hours help to students needing additional instruction. This experience taught me the importance of expressing ideas in various forms to accommodate individual learning styles. Additionally, I have experience guiding younger students from my my high school's robotics group and jazz, concert, and marching bands, where I led and mentored new learners.

In terms of my mathematical ability, I have dedicated my time at university to expanding my knowledge in the field. Although my major is computer science, my minor and true passion is mathematics, encompassing courses such as calculus and linear algebra. In my birth state of Georgia, I won a state-wide mathematics competition, outperforming hundreds of peers. My great aptitude for physics led to me being the aide under Professor Bentley, a nuclear reactor engineer, during my senior year.

One of my closest friends works at Good Samaritan as a teacher for ages three and four. Hearing their stories about the multitude of ways they are able to help those young kids grow and develop inspired me, and I hope that by taking on this role, I can similarly support students with learning disabilities. The patient care of my teachers has been crucial to my personal success, and I aspire to provide the same support to my future students.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Taylor Brannon
