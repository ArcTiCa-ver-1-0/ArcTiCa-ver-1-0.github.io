    right now i'm thinking about whether or not magical hypnosis is nonconsentual
    

- ### Vanilla Valentine _—_ Yesterday at 8:16 PM
    
    i mean it just depends on if you ask them first
    

- ### ambrosia _—_ Yesterday at 8:17 PM
    
    and what is the result of that dependence?
    

- there are at least four outcomes
    

- where you do and dont ask and they do and do not consent
    

- ### Vanilla Valentine _—_ Yesterday at 8:18 PM
    
    i think the only time its consentual is if you ask and they say yes
    

- if you dont do it then its nothing
    

- so thats not really an outcome
    

- not asking and not doing
    

- ### ambrosia _—_ Yesterday at 8:18 PM
    
    what if afterwards, the person agrees that it was necessary, regardless of their consent at the time?
    

does that retroactively change anything?

- ### Vanilla Valentine _—_ Yesterday at 8:19 PM
    
    i dont think that changes anything about whether or not it was consentual
    

- ### ambrosia _—_ Yesterday at 8:19 PM
    
    i agree
    

- maybe a better question is
    

- does it matter
    

- if its for the best and its going to happen anyway, why bother with consent?
    

- yes im thinking about hdg
    

### Vanilla Valentine _—_ Yesterday at 8:20 PM

it's going to happen anyway?

- you're the one doing it
    

- it doesnt happen if you dont do it
    

- ### ambrosia _—_ Yesterday at 8:20 PM
    
    let me reframe the problem
    

- instead of hypnosis, there is a mentally ill patient who needs treatment. their friends and family can ask the person to go
    

- if they don't go, then they will end up committing some crime and get thrown in as rehabilitation anyway
    

- so in the end, they always end up getting treatment
    

- ### Vanilla Valentine _—_ Yesterday at 8:22 PM
    
    i dont think that its guarunteed that they would end up committing a crime
    

- ### ambrosia _—_ Yesterday at 8:22 PM
    
    this is argument land, dear
    

- ### Vanilla Valentine _—_ Yesterday at 8:22 PM
    
    you cant really guaruntee a human will do anything
    

- well
    

- ### ambrosia _—_ Yesterday at 8:22 PM
    
    im trying not to break out the magic
    

- but i will if necessary
    

- eh, fuck it
    

- ### Vanilla Valentine _—_ Yesterday at 8:23 PM
    
    i think you can do things against someones will that are to their overall benefit and by definition its not consentual but the word nonconsentual doesnt imply that it ends badly
    

- the rest of it is just circumstantial, especially for something as broad as magical hypnosis
    

- ### ambrosia _—_ Yesterday at 8:24 PM
    
    hm.
    

- ### Vanilla Valentine _—_ Yesterday at 8:24 PM
    
    like "does it matter" well if you're hypnotizing them to take their meds that they dont wanna take i guess not but if you make them jump off a bridge then yes
    

- ### ambrosia _—_ Yesterday at 8:24 PM
    
    i suppose
    

im trying to understand why someone would read [this](https://archiveofourown.org/works/45125701?view_adult=true "this
(https://archiveofourown.org/works/45125701?view_adult=true)") and come away feeling disturbed

- ### Vanilla Valentine _—_ Yesterday at 8:26 PM
    
    i mean it would be disturbing irl
    

- ### ambrosia _—_ Yesterday at 8:26 PM
    
    how so
    

- ### Vanilla Valentine _—_ Yesterday at 8:26 PM
    
    its pretty clear that they dont actually want this to be happening and that by the end they're just brainwashed
    

- thats horrific
    

- ### ambrosia _—_ Yesterday at 8:26 PM
    
    yes
    

- but its also clear that they want to induce harm to themselves and the people around them
    

- and
    

- its also clear that they have been manipulated and programmed from birth into not wanting it
    

- brainwashed
    

- by humans
    

- ### Vanilla Valentine _—_ Yesterday at 8:27 PM
    
    the human "brainwashing" is just growing up with humans and fighting a war to protect his own kind and the alien brainwashing is literal brainwashing that takes over his body and makes him do things he does not want to do
    

- not really comparable
    

- ### ambrosia _—_ Yesterday at 8:28 PM
    
    i disagree
    

- who in their right mind would see being taken into a loving and caring home where your ever last need is met as being capture which you must escape by any means necessary?
    

- only someone who has been completely brainwashed by the gods of capitalism and humanity
    

- okay. i think i've formed the thought.
    

- in the end, she _does_ end up wanting and liking what is happening to her.
    

- does is matter how she got there?
    

- ### Vanilla Valentine _—_ Yesterday at 8:31 PM
    
    because free will has been removed
    

- it does
    

- ### ambrosia _—_ Yesterday at 8:31 PM
    
    free will was removed before the story began
    

- ### Vanilla Valentine _—_ Yesterday at 8:31 PM
    
    no
    

- ### ambrosia _—_ Yesterday at 8:31 PM
    
    she has free will at the end
    

- most definitely
    

- she says so explicitly
    

- ### Vanilla Valentine _—_ Yesterday at 8:32 PM
    
    i dont think there's any way to agree on this our viewpoints are too different
    

### ambrosia _—_ Yesterday at 8:32 PM

> I fought, I raged, I thought every awful thing I could think of about Ella and Mistress. I tried to hurt Mistress with a sculpting tool. I tried to blow Her up with a pipe bomb! I did so many awful, awful, awful things even before I met them. I hurt so many people. I was OCNI. I was a machine made for hurting people. I was scum. And it didn't matter. They loved me anyway. They loved me even though I didn't deserve it. They gave me this amazing body, this incredible home, their loving company, and a purpose that makes me feel so good about about myself. They shared their art and their passion with me — stars, half of the art they made was either _of_ me or _about_ me.

### Vanilla Valentine _—_ Yesterday at 8:33 PM

they have been brainwashed, mind and body completely altered, and we know that in some capacity the aliens can make them do things they do not want to, so i dont think that their thoughts can even be trusted as their own

- ### ambrosia _—_ Yesterday at 8:34 PM
    
    you know who else has had their mind and body completely altered
    

- ### Vanilla Valentine _—_ Yesterday at 8:34 PM
    
    who
    

- ### ambrosia _—_ Yesterday at 8:34 PM
    
    do you know who else thinks thoughts that cant be trusted as their own
    

do you know who else is made to do things they do not want to do

- the author
    

- and me
    

- and every trans person
    

- everyone with a preventable mental condition
    

- ### Vanilla Valentine _—_ Yesterday at 8:35 PM
    
    i dont think that involves literal alien magic
    

### ambrosia _—_ Yesterday at 8:35 PM

i'd take alien love magic over abuse any day

bpd is caused explicitly by childhood trauma and permanently alters the structure and chemistry of your brain. i've been forced through the wrong puberty.

- my brain screams thoughts at me that i fundamentally do not agree with
    

i can't stop it

- it makes me do things that _i do not want_
    

regardless of the means, the end is the same

- but in the story, the end is happy and the means is love
    

sometimes love means restraining someone who is trying to hurt themselves and others

- sometimes love is changing someone's brain because it has been damaged
    

sometimes love is altering someone's body to be the way it was always supposed to be

i think that's my thought, anyway

### Vanilla Valentine _—_ Yesterday at 8:38 PM

i can see there being an allegory there that i agree with, just not the literal events of the story (which i know is silly to say because its alien magic)

- ### ambrosia _—_ Yesterday at 8:38 PM
    
    the literal events of the story are an outlier edge case
    

- what happened to someone who was too far gone to be given the choice of consent
    

- because they would not take it even if the alternative was death
    

the plot of the text is not the story

the plot is magic

the story is already alive

hdg is a scifi fiction universe containing mostly smut writing by mostly queer, traumatized, neuroatypical people in which the Affini, an axiomatically benevolent species of mostly plantlike creatures, have indomitable control eventually encompassing the entire universe and everyone within it, up to and including the laws of physics themselves. as implied by the name, the core appeal of the project lies in the (power_dynamic)\_kink-centric concept of domestication wherein a sophant[^sophant] is legally stripped of their rights to become a piece of property to their Affini owner, who ostensibly has complete control of them. the actual extent to which this control is exacted ranges from almost not at all to complete mind_and_body control enforced by biotechnological implants which fuse to and eventually replace the individual's nervous system[^nervous-system]. the Affini compact is a post-scarcity imperialist society with the express purpose of spreading its control and prosperity to every species in the entire universe.

[^sophant]: an intelligent being with base reasoning capacity roughly equivalent to or greater than that of a human. superset of those with personhood.
[^nervous-system]: or equivalent; not every species is similar to ours.

if any part of this concept makes you uncomfortable[^uncomfortable], you are not alone. it is not unreasonable to draw parallels between the Affini and ugly parts of human history, and indeed it is the very negative connotation of dehumanization which gives the setting such a powerful sultry appeal. it may be surprising, then, that the project is home to comparable parts dominatric_degradation_fetish-fics and soft, comfortable, loving cozy-works; perhaps more surprising is the number of think-pieces almost absent of sex which touch on philosophical premises i have not seen the likes of anywhere else.

[^uncomfortable]: or aroused
___
this kind of sucks. ideally i just never directly address the fact that it's smut.
___

i asked not to be taken to the psych ward. my consent was not required. once within, i made every effort to mask and manipulate my way out as quickly as i could manage. i was successful in part because of the evidence of drugs in my system. therefore, i did not gain anything from my being there. i did not want to be there.

but if i had failed,

if i hadn't been able to leave,

would my noncompliance still have prevented me from reaping benefit?

___
the Affini represent the limit of theory which we will ride the intermediate value theorem up to. 

humanity's strive for science turning magic into better lives for us all. but also. the human's strive to better the lives of those they are connected to. 
___
i was made into something worse.
they make into something better.

# if it isn't possible, why even think about it?

the sentiment implies that letting yourself daydream about winning the lottery will only serve to make you more upset with your current state of being and set you into lethargy from the perceived injustice of not getting the magic ticket or the futility of moving upwards without it.

i used to daydream about being a girl.

i daydream about utopia so that i may conceptualize the direction which i ought to aim.
