### amber _—_ Yesterday at 5:27 PM

okay

- so the key realization came from considering what happened in my childhood
    

- if i did something my dad perceived as wrong, i have two options
    

- either admit to having done it or lie about it
    

- obviously, when i lied, i could either get away with it or not
    

- however, there is no "getting away with it" when telling the truth
    

- therefore, we have this:
    
    - Truth => Punishment
    - Lie, fail => Punishment
    - Lie, success => No punishment
    

- therefore if i know that whatever i'm being questioned about is something bad, it is literally always strictly optimal to lie and deny it
    

- however
    

- this only works
    

- because...
    

- 1. there is no dynamic relationship; my dad will always hate me the same amount
    2. the punishment for truth and lie is equal
    

- hm
    

let me figure out how to transition into the next bit

- or you can speak for a bit if you want
    

- ~intermission~
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 5:31 PM
    
    If the punishment for lying is dramatically worse than the punishment for truth you get really sketched out by lies. (My experience)
    
- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 5:32 PM
    
    yes, but for a variety of reasons, that was not the case when i was a kid
    

- not particularly relevant right now
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 5:32 PM
    
    Sorry :( I know I was just saying my experience
    

- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 5:32 PM
    
    no need to apologize!
    

- i appreciate your input
    
- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 5:32 PM
    
    I mean this was pretty aggressive
    

- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 5:33 PM
    
    and i was expanding on it by clarifying why it does not match mine
    

### amber _—_ Yesterday at 5:33 PM

ohhh, no sorry

- i meant
    

- the reasons for why my punishments are the same
    

- are not relevant right now
    

- your experience and input is always relevant, valued, and accepted, my love
    

- i apologize for the confusion
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 5:34 PM
    
    oh that is fair. I am sorry I misunderstood
    

- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 5:34 PM
    
    hug it out?
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 5:34 PM
    
    _hug tight_
    

- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 5:34 PM
    
    _hug_ <3
    

- communication is the most difficult task we undertake
    

- we must be careful and forgiving with our partners
    

- anyhow
    

- transitioning from childhood abuse to real relationships
    

- in the case of the successful lie, i basically have this internal concept of the results making the past
    

- like
    

- if i lie and get away with it, it is in my best interest to convince myself that the lie is true so that, if questioned on the same matter again, the lie can remain consistent, as is required to be convincing
    

- basically
    

- there's this technically incorrect idea of successful lies eventually patching up the past
    

technically incorrect, but effective to consider true in an abusive environment of the type i was in

- so
    

- when i have a situation like today
    

- it is tempting to think something like this:
    

- if i tell the truth, ellie will most likely have a neutral reaction, but there is a chance that she has a negative reaction. if i lie, i can guarantee that ellie will have a neutral reaction
    

- therefore, in the moment, it seems correct to lie in order to avoid the potential negative reaction
    

- however, this obviously fails to consider the future
    

- it influences our relationship going forward
    

- and in this case, "patching up the past" is actually just accidentally pushing off important growth discussions
    

- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 5:41 PM
    
    this, combined with the fact that my internal model incorrectly assumed that others had the same understanding of lying _and_ the fact that it was always optimal for me to never admit that i was lying in the past
    

- means that
    

- in the moment
    

- i never consider the obvious worst-case scenario
    

- i suppose that my brain was basically like
    

- "oh if the lie is found out, thats fine. theyll understand that it was the correct thing to do because it protected their feelings"
    

- but obviously, dumb monkey brain
    

- that ignores the fact that they still have to deal with the actual truth and that negative reaction
    

- and the fact that this harms relationships, whereas if someone lied to me i would not even blink
    

- so
    

- all of that
    

- is my current understanding
    

- of why i have been a habitual liar
    

- and why it is wrong
    

- i am autism
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 5:45 PM
    
    Okay, so putting it clear like if I find our you're lying my reaction will almost always be worse than if tell me an unpleasant truth. Because like you said I have to learn the unpleasant truth, but then I also have to deal with our relationship could be thrown in doubt. because like it raises the thought of what else she could be lying about
    
- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 5:46 PM
    
    rambly response to this?
    
- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 5:46 PM
    
    yes
    

- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 5:46 PM
    
    kk
    

- <ramble>
    

- so
    

- i very much appreciate your utter transparency

- - (personal thinking-out-loud to further understand myself; does not discount the above!) i think that part of me knew, or indeed had to have known, that this was the case. i think that that's part of why i gave up the lie and, sensibly, why doing so made me so uncomfortable. the cognitive dissonance between my internal decision process and the facts i know has historically been extremely difficult for me to try to resolve, likely due to the immense amount of shame surrounding the entire subject
    

- i absolutely agree with the rest and have nothing else intellectual to add. emotionally, i am not sure what to do beyond further apology and to put in the work and effort to better myself for us

- </ramble>
    

- (that means ramble is over)
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 5:52 PM
    
    I know all I ask is that you keep being here and keep putting in the work for our relationship. I suppose that means we need to decide what it is
    
- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 5:53 PM
    
    would you like me to give my initial thoughts on action items for myself to improve, or should we circle back to that and handle the latter part now?
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 5:54 PM
    
    Let's end with self improvement because it's a good happy note for the future
    

- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 5:54 PM
    
    _nodnod_
    

- can i take a few minutes break?
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 5:54 PM
    
    of course. take as long as you need
    

- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 5:56 PM
    
    thank you. i get mentally tired from all of the communication, and so i want to rest in order to ensure that you can have me at my best for the next step in this discussion. i say all that because i have some small, lingering anxiety over my asking being interpreted as me not giving you my full time, effort, and attention, when in reality i intend the exact opposite. i don't believe that you interpreted it this way; this is just a bit of self-soothing to get over some past trauma
    

- anyway, i go pee and drink water now
    

- ill check in 10 minutes from now if im not ready by then
    

### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 5:57 PM

yes go pee and drink water. I will be here.

- I love yoy
    

- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:01 PM
    
    i love you too! i think im ready now :3
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:02 PM
    
    Okay! I am here
    

### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:04 PM

so

- ellie
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:04 PM
    
    Yes?
    

- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:04 PM
    
    would you like to be my girlfriend?
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:04 PM
    
    I would very much like to be your girlfirne
    

- girlfriend
    

- ![😳](https://discord.com/assets/a78cb3d395b95e16ab43.svg)
    

- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:04 PM
    
    wonderful :)
    

- would you like to discuss the implications of this label?
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:05 PM
    
    We can do that. I think it might help us both
    

### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:05 PM

okay

- let's eat the frog and start with commitment
    

- mmm
    

- wrong word
    

- let's start in the "what is okay to do and have with others" area
    

- i think that is the most sore spot right now
    

- would you agree?
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:07 PM
    
    Yeah I mean it honestly isn't that sore. I know I can't really control you and you want to give your love to as many people as possible.
    

- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:07 PM
    
    i would prefer to come into this afresh
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:07 PM
    
    Okay
    

- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:07 PM
    
    start from nothing
    

- i think i ought to elaborate on my existing and near-past relationships which are relevant
    

- or would you like to go first?
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:08 PM
    
    Um you can go first. I am starting from nothing right?
    

- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:08 PM
    
    this should be a simple stating of the facts so that we can be clear on where our starting point is
    

- i'll go
    

- so, for about a year and up until a few months ago, i was in a commitment partnership with dawn
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:09 PM
    
    what's a commitment partnership?
    

- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:09 PM
    
    we were dating and heavily romantically and emotionally involved, and we had sex regularly
    

- she was the only person during the time with which i had a relationship of such intensity and depth
    

- outside of family, i suppose
    

- it was not monogamous, but we were definitely each other's primary partners
    

- does that clear that up?
    

- if so i'll continue
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:11 PM
    
    Yeah that makes sense
    

- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:12 PM
    
    at the time, we were planning to move in together and we talked about being together for the rest of our lives
    

- a few months ago, my condition had gotten to the point where she felt it was necessary to distance from me
    

- i was effectively using her as a support more than she felt was healthy
    

- and we hoped that by removing one layer of that safety net, i would be able to compel myself to take the action necessary to improve myself
    

- a couple months later, or a little over a month ago, i was visiting my mother
    

- i was there because of a massive lie i told her
    

- she pestered me every day about my job search and at one point i grew so frustrated with it and upset at the imposed feelings of inadequacy that i said i had lined up three interviews
    

- i had none, in reality
    

- as i do, i continued paving out the lie at every inquiry. having three interviews turned into three in louisville turned into me staying the night at her place so that i didn't have to drive as much turned into her taking me to the mall for interview outfits
    

- in retrospect i consider it near psychosis
    

- the ability to which i deluded myself into living the lie
    

- regardless
    

- while in louisville, dawn and i were texting since we had gotten more friendly in the recent weeks
    

- she asked why i was in the area and i told her that i was there for the interviews, which i of course did not actually have
    

- for some context
    

- even at the time
    

- i did not lie to dawn except in circumstances like this
    

- i would lie to my parents constantly
    

- but never to her
    

- but
this situation just

crossed things, i guess

i genuinely feel like it was an accident even though i seemingly made every choice

- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:19 PM
    
    but
    

- anyway
    

- one thing led to another and we decided that we could begin being closer again
    

- part of her reasoning was because she took my interviews as a sign of my improvement
    

- but the next day when she asked me about them in detail, i gave up the lie and admitted that there were none
    

- i could have kept lying and gotten away with it
    

- fabricating detail before wrapping up the story with three rejections from the fictional companies
    

- but i told her the truth
    

- because i
    

- don't want to lie
    

- and
    

- it
    

- shattered the psychosis, i suppose
    

- but
    

- she naturally was extremely hurt
    

- felt betrayed and manipulated and used
    

- and she has since said to not be speaking to me until i get serious psychiatric treatment
    

- in the time since i have broken down a handful of times and reached out to her regardless since she was the only person i had, and she responded where she could, but continued to assert that anything more would need to wait until i get treatment
    

- my last break, before i sent myself to the hospital right after meeting you, led to her blocking my number, so i don't know if she got my text saying that i went
    

- but
    

- she says she still loves me
    

- and i still love her
    

- we want to be together when i am able
    

- i have had lifelong commitments to people before her
    

- bpd fueled
    

- and they broke
    

- and it is with that context that i say that dawn is genuinely different from those
    

- i love her and i will always love her and she has shaped my worldview to such an extent that i cannot ever be parted from her
    

- i don't know if we will ever be in a committed relationship again, but it is impossible for me to imagine a future where i am unable to express my love for her
    

- and that's dawn
    

aside from her, i have sex with people when i'm lonely and have no friends. i'm more than willing to stop that

### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:26 PM

i don't think it's possible for me to not get romantically attached to people

bpd flights of fancy are difficult to suppress

- but
    

- i am willing to go into any future romances with the condition that i will make it clear that they must be less committal than what you and i have, should that be what you desire
    

- given all that
    

- i think i should say
    

- that
    

- even though we haven't known each other long
    

- i think that the way i feel about you now will prove to develop into a feeling similar to and as devotional as that which i have with dawn
    

- would you like to say anything
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:29 PM
    
    Yeah. I have a few things that popped into my head. I wanted to let you finish first tho
    

- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:30 PM
    
    going on would just be me saying the ways i love you
    

- ha
    

- oh
    

- wait
    

- um
    

- one more small thing
    

- i will not agree to not be physically intimate with people while i am alone
    

- (i won't cum except for you, BUT)
    

- my need for touch is very real and human, and depriving myself of it is bad for me
    

if and when we are physically together, i will be more than happy to keep it exclusive if that is what you like

oh

- and
    

- i guess another thing
    

- but i can save it i guess
    

- well
    

- no
    

- everything we say here
    

- i want to stick to
    

- but
    

### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:32 PM

I won't lie. Knowing you have someone who will always supersede me is really intimidating. It kinda circles back to what I talked about last night. All it needs is you loving one person more who doesn't like me,, more, and I lose you.


### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:33 PM

i want us both to have the understanding that if and when dawn renters my life, the three of us will need to discuss everything anew

### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:33 PM

i reject the implication that she supersedes you

### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:33 PM

you flat out said you do not love me as much as you love her

- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:33 PM
    
    my mistake, then
    

- i meant to say that i absolutely do love you as much as her, for as much as love can be quantified
    

however, i have learned to be patient and not commit myself to things too quickly due to bpd

if i promised my entire life to everyone i felt strongly about, i would have a harem three hundred strong

you are proving to be different than the typical bpd romance fires, though

i still love you over a week in

- my love has not only grown but refined into something more meaningful, appreciable, and mature
    

- this is not the behavior which is to be expected of a short flight of fancy
    

and so i am cautiously stating that assuming all of our future advances together go as well as we hope, i will be more than happy to continue to consider you in the same manner as i do dawn

basically

- right now
    

- you and her are "equal" in my brain
    

- i know better than to say "oh it's gonna stay that way forever" to someone i've known less than a month
    

but it's looking real good

- and if and when we meet in person and things are still good
    

- i'm gonna lock down that forever
    

- i'm serious about you
    

- sorry i'm bad at explaining things
    

### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:38 PM

Okay. If you're sure. I won't lie the idea that you could just stop loving me out of the blue is really worrying. But if you believe it won't happen I suppose I'll grin and bear it.

### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:39 PM

oh no there is absolutely zero possibility that i stop loving you out of the blue

- i give it at least a 99% chance that we are together forever. the one percent comes from things which are outside of both of our control
    

- i don't want to promise forever until i can be _absolutely sure_ that it can be 100% and it simply cannot until we have been together physically
    

- the 1% is stuff like "i'm deathly allergic to you" or some shit like that
    

- there is no chance of my feelings waning
    

- i love you and my love for you will only grow for as long as i am lucky enough to be with you
    

### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:41 PM

Ooooh. Okay. I misread that. I am sorry that I assigned worseness to your thoughts. I thought that was more in a, if she's uglier than her pictures I'm done thing

### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:41 PM

communication is difficult

### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:41 PM

It really really is

### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:42 PM

but it's also the most important and worthwhile thing possible

because it is what makes Us

i want a forever with you

and i genuinely believe that we can make it happen

we just have to hope no one nukes kentucky first

damn, i should have just said that from the start

### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:43 PM

I love you too alot. I am just rereading back over stuff because I knew there was more I wanted to comment on

### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:44 PM

take your time

- this is important
    

- nothing is set in stone, though, luckily
    

- we will grow and our relationship with it
    
- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:45 PM
    
    This line worries me in particular. Would she be okay with me in our role? At the end of the day this is a lot of talking over someone I don't know a ton about.
    

- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:46 PM
    
    yes; i have had much the same discussion with her as with you. i promised her a forever only after we both understood that it was not exclusive
    

### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:46 PM

I prefer that. Just for safety reasons. I don't want any of us to get STDs.

- Only have sex with people who you care about and know are safe please :(
    
- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:47 PM
    
    yes ma'am!
    

- oh!
    

- if i am wanting to have sex with someone
    

- do you want:
    
    - me to tell you in advance
    - me to tell you afterwards
    - us to discuss it in advance, with the final sovereignty given to me
    - us to discuss it in advance, with you having the ability to veto
    - none of the above
    

- ~~not ordered in the brightest way but i'm on my phone~~
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:49 PM
    
    afterwards I think. If you tell me before that just means I need to sit alone, not having fun and be sad while my girlfriend gets laid.
    

### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:50 PM

oh, wait

hm

- i suppose
    

- so
    

for sex in particular

- i think we need to talk about it in terms of right now, when i am physically away from you, and the future, when i will not be
    

- to me it only makes sense to talk about now
    

- and
    

- honestly for now
    

- i'm so fine with not having sex with anyone
    

- i really only need cuddles
    

- i like sexting with you more
    

- so we can scratch all that honestly haha
    

- ...i actually like the idea of me being chaste for you quite a lot
    

can we do that please

hehe

### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:53 PM

That is fair. IDK I don't want to force you into stuff. Like I want you to do what makes you happy. :( I'm sorry I am a stick in the mud. IDK like I am fine with you having sex with people now if it really draws you in. But yeah we can do that. My Princess saving herself for true love lmfao.

### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:53 PM

hehehe

if something changes and i _really_ wanna fuck someone (which i do not foresee happening) then we will talk about it. ![🤝](https://discord.com/assets/6e98b2fcb718327b912a.svg)![❓](https://discord.com/assets/279c95da967d9f205683.svg)

oh shit wait

um

fuck i forgot about

goddamn it lol

- ugh
    

- okay so
    

- um
    

- separate from you and dawn
    

- and everyone else
    

- in
    

- another dimension
    

- um
    

- is
    

- my sib
    

- do
    

- you wanna talk about that
    

- or
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:55 PM
    
    So dawn and your sib are different people?
    

### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:55 PM

yes

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:55 PM
    
    Okay
    

- I wasn't sure
    

- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:55 PM
    
    my sib goes by a lot of names
    

- but azzy is a common one
    

### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:55 PM

But can I address one or two more things and then we'll loop back around to Azzy?

- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:55 PM
    
    yesyes

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:57 PM
    
    I think this is the last line I wanted to draw attention to. I think I'd prefer that? Like if you meet someone and they're on a level like me and dawn can you please discuss it first?
    

- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:57 PM
    
    absolutely, i would do that even if you didn't ask it
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:58 PM
    
    Okay. Thank you. I think that's my last point on that stuff
    

- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 6:58 PM
    
    okay
    

- should we do a recap before moving on or do you wanna save that until the end?
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Yesterday at 6:59 PM
    
    I'm not sure we need a recap. Unless you think it might help?
    

- ### amber _—_ Yesterday at 7:00 PM
    
    i wanna at least have one at the end
    

we can move on for now :3

- so!
    

- azzy
    

- she is not blood but for all intents and purposes she is my family
    

- in my mind, family is on a completely separate plane from romance
    

- both have their own concept of love
    

- but it genuinely does not make sense to me to try to restrict things with her in the way i would with anyone else
    

even the concept of measurement breaks down for me, idk

her and my sister, sylvia, but sylvia lives very far away and i haven't gotten to see her physically but once, so she doesn't come up in these conversations much

- so
    

- in the past i have had sex with them
    

- and i would very much like to have the ability to do so on occasion in the future
    

- and i do mean on occasion; it's never a regular occurrence
    

- if you object to that, we can discuss

    That is absolutely fine. I wouldn't take you away from literal family lol

    okay, thank you
    

so my siblings will be the only people exempt from the restrictions
