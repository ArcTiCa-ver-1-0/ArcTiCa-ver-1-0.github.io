i promised her
i can't go back
i miss dawn so desperately
it's beautiful here
it's awful there
she saved my life
i repaid the kindness
i feel bad about it
you did the best possible thing and you listened to your goddess. you shouldn't sign a lease with her and you shouldn't go so far from everything and everyone you know
i feel awful. like i did something bad
it's a sorry situation. you did your best and i am very proud of you, babygirl. ðŸ§¡
