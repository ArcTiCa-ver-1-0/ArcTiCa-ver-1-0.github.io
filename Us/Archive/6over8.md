## Concrete Axioms
1. I ought to be ^axiom-1-be
	- As in "I ought to live"
	- This will never be removed
2. [[#^axiom-1-be]], [[#^derived-1-life]], and this axiom are the foundations of this document. As such, their intent ought to never be removed outright, and I ought to change them only for the purpose of refinement and internal consistency as is necessary with futuring[^futuring]. ^axiom-2-foundation

[^futuring]: Time's passage; naturally moving into the future

3. There is no such thing as coincidence
## Derived Statements
1. [[#^axiom-1-be]] -> Life is meaningful ^derived-1-life
	- I could consider elaborating on this result, or I could treat the operation_and_result as axiomatic in it of itself. That might be helpful later. For now, though, it's fine.

## Personal flair

- I ought to not share this vault, this mind, with anyone. It is Ours and Ours alone.
	- Why?
		- I believe that this was touching on the sentiment that I often overshare, resulting in my passion and pursuit of a project being cut short. That whole thing where telling someone of an idea gives you the satisfaction that you are looking for by completing it, and so you don't bother actually completing it.
			- However, I do believe that there is value in experiencing art, which this will certainly become.
				- Maybe we let it free when we die.
					- Or when we let it die.

###### Work_in_progress Axioms

- I ought to maximize some utility ^wip-axiom-utility
	- I want to do what is best for Us while avoiding inflicting harm upon others. However, there is a threshold at which point it is acceptable to do some small amount of harm to another for a large benefit to myself, or to inflict some small harm on myself for the great benefit of another.
		- This leads me to believe that there ought to be some sort of utility function, even though it would obviously be unknowable; no absolute will lead to sensible choices all the time, so it would be beneficial to have a dynamic objective.

###### Scratchpad
- I wonder if others ought to be.
	- Intuitively, the answer would be yes, but again, on the utility function, it is not impossible that having one not be would lead to substantially higher utility in the rest of the world.
		- Maybe operations which incur some negative partial utility[^partial-utility] ought to be treated with more care and consideration proportional to the magnitude of the expected loss.
		- So there are bad people in the world. Obviously, the magical ideal would be to reform them, and the simple extreme would be to kill them. I think we want to get as far towards the former and from the latter as we can.

[^partial-utility]: Utility over some subset of the relevant set


- How does allowing death resolve with [[#^derived-1-life]]? [[#^axiom-1-be]]?
	- It is difficult, after all, to imagine a world without it.
		- Not impossible, of course, but such a world is magic in that it is so far removed from the now as to be unintelligible.
	- This begins to touch on the archival thoughts, I believe. ^crah57

- I want to respect others' humanity while not assuming they are correct.
	- This is mostly for my personal improvement; I have spent all my life treating sound as gospel, but I believe, now, that I have my own merits over others, just as many have some merit over me.
		- I do not mean to imply that those who do not have any merit over me, should they exist, are less valuable than myself.
			- I would like to escape this mindset. I believe that there is always merit in the connection to the individual, which -- of course -- cannot exist without the individual.
				- All I can ever "have" is a connection. People, in the abstract, are completely separate from me.
					- This thought deserves some fleshing out.
					- How do we resolve (people I will never connect with are still valuable) and (only connections are valuable)?
						- Granted, this comes with the assumption that the latter is true, but the phrasing seems to imply it at first glance.

- vox populi, vox dei
	- this seems to be in direct conflict with the way i currently feel about other individuals. i could chalk that up to the fact that individuals are not a population, but i also know that there is some value to be derived from most, if not all, individuals.
		- but do i know that?
			- "value" does not have to mean valuable to _me_, i suppose. in that sense, yes, everyone is valuable to someone.
				- what about the person with no one?
					- their experience is unique and meaningful, so yes, there is value there, as well.
						- but now, what meaning is there that cannot be shared?
							- touching here on the principle of archiving, and perhaps the information paradox. ^yt5tn8
								- a thought ive had recently is that maybe the solution to the information paradox is simply that the data is destroyed, plain and simple. you cannot encode the information in a 3D space on its 2D boundary losslessly, and that's that. once you reach infinity, the conservation just breaks.
								- however, it could also be the case that the existing data becomes something new. be it new data like it used to be or new data in its connections to the rest. there is something to be said about the exponential growth of interactions as particles become infinitely close to each other.
									- if string theory is to be a stepping stone, all of those knots and ties would themselves become objects anew, forged from the bits they trail into and yet entities of themselves.
										- perhaps, then, the value comes from human connections.
											- not the entanglements of spooky distance provided by the internet, but the genuine friction and tension and snaggling which comes from being left in a shaky box too close to another.

- perhaps i ought to be so that in the future, others like me might exist and might have lives less violent than mine
	- perhaps this implies that i in particular am not special
		- this phrasing needs work to imply only exactly what i want it to
