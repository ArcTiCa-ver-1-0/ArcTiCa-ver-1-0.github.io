	- It would be nice to be able to link browser instances in here.
	- Headers should work the same as list items should work the same as any sort of bulleting as far as the keyboard is concerned
	- There should be a "right click" universal keyboard command

-> [[project ideas]]: Make an automatic changelog generator
	- for when people ask "what did you do today?"
