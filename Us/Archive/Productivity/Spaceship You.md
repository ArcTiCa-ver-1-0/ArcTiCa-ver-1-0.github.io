###### Intro
> [[Alone, Together|Alone, Together.]]

> Here inside, it may seem like you have naught to do but to watch and wait, but aboard this ship, ... , there are dangers too. What can start as a break from life _will_, unchecked, become something much worse: darkness and disorder and a slow drift into abyss, where, out here, _no one can physically help you_. So you cannot just wait. Like those below, you above have things to do. ... **Your mission: return better than you left.** To accomplish this, _you must maintain the vessel_.
- the precise wording seems to imply that by maintaining the vessel, the mission will be accomplished. i hope that can be the case. ^qu484w

> Welcome aboard spaceship You.

###### Entropy
> The passive forces of the universe work to slow that which is active, to bring darkness and disorder.
- It is _expected_ that apathy and sedation will bring degradation; to expect otherwise is the madness of denying natural truth. It is also expected that effort and energy expended in one place will yield motion in another.

###### Halves of a whole
> The mental and physical are halves of a whole.
- perhaps another aspect of [[Alone, Together]] to think about.
	- the primary aspect being, of course, Us.
		- I have been neglecting Us. ... .but there is no use dwelling. there is only the present, in which i will make decisions which direct me towards the future Me that i want to be.

###### The worst case scenario
> You are on your own. Your brain and how it thinks are all you have. And brains, when dangerously apathetic and agitated usually can't just think themselves better. Brains are complicated messes, but physical activity is simple and brings brains back to baseline. _When the ship is in trouble, prime with the physical_.

> Getting yourself to the right physical space at the right time is a big part of the job of existing. Yet here you are, in one all-room. Thus, the first task is to divide your physical space. No matter how small your vessel, there will be at least four sides to create four vital stations to operate the ship.
- i really like the internal cylinder quartered image. translates nicely to my square all-room.
- i notice that i am not using one of my four quarters -- in fact, until today, i wasn't using but two in this life, really. perhaps it should be the exercise station in accompaniment with the outside world that i thankfully have access to.

- the first is for exercise; something... beyond the bare minimum \[...\]
	- so that priming the core is easier when you need to
	- [ ] create this simplest station first
	- bitter medicine, but it is ==_non-optional_==

- from this point on, crossing this border is how you mentally and physically decide to do the [thing]
- degrading the station degrades ability and mission success
- if the brain does not yield within 30 minutes, leave and come back later

- sleepy distractions should be sleepy things

- look around you. _this_ is your actionable environment.

- [ ] reduce couching. always try to minimize couching. no excuses. bitter medicine, but we want to be _great._
	- eats into the hours and hides the state of the core. lapsing into lethargy, descent into self-erosion
- sanctify a recreation station which you will give your full attention.
	- incl social stuff!
	- keep an eye on the maximum and quality of time.

- creation
	- creating your environment which will start a positive feedback loop
	- borders are everything you have the power to affect, including yourself
	- creating and doing what others value
	- _something._ more than nothing.
		- you have all the hours you need to become better than what you were before.
	- similar to sleep. keep it especially hygienic. only to create, not to consume.
		- allow yourself to be a bit bored at the start before slipping into it.
		- [ ] enact more control on the laptop, which is my creation device
	- if you are tempted, get up and leave. that's okay. it's better to be honest keep the borders strict. don't even consume. go when you need a break and return when you are ready.

- make them feel like truly different spaces.

- ==as the only crew==, maintain the stations _and the stations will maintain you._

- figuring out how to run it isn't easy. failures will happen. but do not berate yourself. ==there is only one thing to do==; keep the core spinning. come back better than before.


OKAY BUT RESPECTING THE BORDERS IS THE HARD PART
