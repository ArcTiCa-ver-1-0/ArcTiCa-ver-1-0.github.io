# Thursday

- cozy seems to be a momentum sink. once i get in, it takes me a while to get out. it also, probably, takes a while to truly get in.

- [ ] need to finish [[Spaceship You]]
- [ ] wanna keep watching Murder Drones
- [ ] i also wanna rewatch some No Boilerplate

- [ ] ought to shower today, probably when i get home.

## gossamer thoughts

- the system is the work. ^i9zp7g
- what about the tools?

- heat makes diamonds

- it doesn't matter if others don't see the results of your work. it is very well invisible to them.
	- we operate on momentum. we need to build up our inertia over time through the construction of systems and the gradual adaptation of our mind. three applications in a week were followed by ten in a day. never forget that, beautiful. <3

##

- wonder if it's worth having notes for stuff like Murder Drones and Bipolar.
- what do i want this vault to be?
- simpler question first: what ought a vault be?
	- a mind
- and now, what should this one be?
	- Our mind
- [ ] it seems, then, that yes, there ought to be notes for those sorts of things.
 ^7i1fek
- [ ] wanna learn symlinks

- [[Alone, Together]] tying the theme and [[6over8|religion]]...?
	- i think i'd like the theme bit to focus on [[Spaceship You]]

# Friday

- i really ought to do some cursory research on bipolar before settling on anything conceptually.
- [ ] once i do, re-review [[Friday, May 31st, 2024 - Logfile#^bipolar]]

- remember that the purpose of any [[6over8|religion]] ought to be to help its followers.

- [ ] think about affirmations
	- [[Friday, May 31st, 2024 - Logfile#^affirmation]]

- i like who i am today <3

- a mindset shift may help in tackling uncomfortable social things. i think its at least worth trying. what exactly that means remains to be seen.
- [ ] come back to this when i have an interview :3

- wow, We are really fucking awesome haha

- intentionality isn't the godlike sword We imagined it would be, mostly because knowing what to be intentional about is half the problem. however, keeping it on the mind (theme) is _always_ helpful; don't reverse sunk cost[^reverse-sunk-cost] yourself!

[^reverse-sunk-cost]: the fallacy of not wanting to do something unless it will be perfect or completely eliminate a problem

- [ ] i ought to draw more! its fun and i like having the drawings afterwards :)

- [ ] [[Tasks]].add: Link Logfiles .>>

- how magical it would be if we could turn our wonder directly into action...
	- building tools and supports brings us closer to that world!

- [x] i want to be brave enough to declare that i won't share this vault with anyone. ... and so i will. [[6over8|religion]].add .<<
	- so proud <3

- Dawn does not exist in Our Now. This is both difficult and freeing. Let's take conquer the former and use the latter <3
- y'know, mom isn't either, and that's fuckin' _great_ lmao
