hey, ellie. i've been thinking and i just think that my place isn't here.
i'm really homesick. like, really, really homesick. 
i love you with all my heart. i truly do. and im so proud of how much better you've gotten. but i think it's time for you to put into practice what you have learned. 
but this isn't about her. this is about me. 
i need to go home. i feel my goddess calling to me. there is something incredibly important waiting for me there. i hope you can understand one day. 
i love you with all my heart, always and forever. ðŸ’œ
