.
hello, little spider. do you run from the steam?
,
there you go, dancing again. though your creation may be invisible to me, your actions are enough to convey its beauty.
,
not to retreat to a hiding hole, but to stand firm, and strong, in the warm
for you know
that the hard worker makes the tools which will feed the mind
and that the hard worker just might survive
.
