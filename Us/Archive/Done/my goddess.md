my goddess was sitting on a bridge a little after 10 pm. 

i saw more stars than i ever could at the hab. heard more peace and nature than we were allowed to know.

my goddess faced the oncoming train and closed her eyes

i left with blisters on my heel and stumbled back down the rocks

aghast with indescribable awe at the scaffold
___
someone who had just been robbed of everything dragged their heel through the transient shoreline, asking no one, no god, knowing no chance would let it escape the eroding tide before first light, and not knowing how to feel about it. 

someone who had nothing to run to ran out of runway and turned around, preferring the waterside to broken pavement. another three hours later, someone who chose to come back to not a home rode the elevator to the top floor. another thirty seconds later, someone who had exhausted every thought disregarded a no-entry sign capping off an ascent. another six minutes later, someone who couldn't bring themselves to fall traded the roaring winds for stagnant facades. another minute later, someone who didn't want to be alive was lectured for another twenty minutes. or something like that. i don't have a very good memory. 

but i do remember the feeling when they took my phone. i remember my entire consciousness dropping out of my stomach as my next steps became inevitable. before they could even look, i had my shoes on and was out the door and down the staircase and out the parking deck and across the sprinkler-fed lawns and between trailer decks and weaving backstreets and plodding hard sand and swelling tide pools and the sun setting long before anything was over. i remember wanting to drown. i remember wanting to sell my body. i remember wanting to become homeless. but i've always been submissive to my survival instincts. so i ducked police lights until i couldn't walk anymore and then i turned around and walked back because i was a prisoner without chains.
___
the second time up the rickets i knew quickly that i wouldn't be able to do it. i kept walking to the part of the waterway again, sticking my legs under the bars again, clinging to rust again. 

i thought about her a lot. i suppose i decided it was worth it. 

yeah, i definitely did. i remember thinking that it was literally impossible for things to get any worse. 

i had no wardens any longer. complete control of my cell. i believed in myself and my ability to improve my situation, myself, the way i felt. it was easier when i had literally nothing. or maybe i was just used to it at that point. 

my goddess turned and watched the stars, leaning against a breaker for fear of heights despite want to die.
___
want for safety. want for escape. want for relief. want for finality. want for peace. want for justice. want for art. want for meaning. want for rebellion. want for spite. want for revenge.

refusal to live in a world yet worse than the one i had barely endured.
___
i just want my stuffie. i just want my headphones. i just want to go to sleep. i just want to leave. i just want to be normal. i just want to be happy.
___
train horns aren't made to sound beautiful. i don't know why i like them other than nostalgia. the quiet nights in the basement were made more peaceful with their presence.

i miss that dark room.
i miss hiding my switch between the bed frame and the wall.
i miss being excited to talk to people online through whatever means i could.
___
i guess it started even back with yoko. i was still using omegle and shit when we were together. especially once i left for uni. isolation is hard.

i tried not to think about it.

i don't remember what i thought, even.

i told them because i cared. i told them because i was guilty about lying. i told them because i cared. i told them because i was guilty about cheating. i told her because i cared. i told her because i couldn't bear to lie anymore. 

why did i even do it?
i thought i cared about upmost honesty with them. i knew i could trust them with anything. except i couldn't, not once i was over the precipice. indulging sick and perverted fetishized craving. kissing someone blackout drunk. pretending to be better than i am. more. more. always more. more. i didn't do it. i know there is irrefutable evidence but i didn't do it. it wasn't me. the punishment is always better if you don't admit. he just calls you stupid and hits you and you don't have to talk as much. he just feels like i am nothing, a worthless useless hopeless liar, and it's better he think that than that i chose to do whatever made him pissed. because if i chose that then i was competent and deserving of whatever punishment he wanted to inject.
___
my earliest memory is getting my nails painted. my second oldest memory is my brother being bullied for wearing a dress he was forced into. my third oldest memory is staring into a corner. 
___
i make people like me happy and then we part ways. a traveling healer, maybe. except i never move. most of the time. 
___
to be completely honest, cutting feels really fucking good. i miss doing it.
___
