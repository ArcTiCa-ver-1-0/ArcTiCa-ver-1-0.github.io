Mwahhh how are you feeling? Have you done anything since you finished edging?

### amber _—_ Today at 11:45 AM

i'm actually about to go get lunch with someone! so i won't be able to talk for a bit :3

### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 11:46 AM

Okay! Have fun.

Who're you going with?

### amber _—_ Today at 11:48 AM

just a friend

### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 11:49 AM

That's fair! I was just curious.

- ### amber _—_ Today at 11:49 AM
    
    aside, but i always find that question strange to answer
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 11:50 AM
    
    Oh. I'm sorry. I just don't know much about your friends and stuff. I know you've said you don't have a lot of places to go so I wasn't sure what the situation was. Or like if you were getting a free meal off a dating app chaser lol
    

- ### amber _—_ Today at 11:50 AM
    
    mh,, yeah it's the latter,, i white lied cause i didn't wanna distress you
    

i thought it would be best if you didn't know since there's no harm

weh

idk if i did the right thing

but

i had good intent

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 11:51 AM
    
    Mwaaaah. Have fun. Stay safe. Don't get raped lol.
    

### amber _—_ Today at 11:51 AM

are you alright?

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 11:52 AM
    
    what do you mean?
    

### amber _—_ Today at 11:52 AM

i mean

- did that distress or upset you?
    

### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 11:53 AM

I mean I am a bit anxious and I want you to stay safe. But making sure you eat is more important. Just sad that someone else is getting you before I can lol

- ### amber _—_ Today at 11:53 AM
    
    i don't plan on having sex
    

- and i will stay safe
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 11:54 AM
    
    Okay. Just as long as you stay safe
    

- Although you already lied once about this :/ so idk. Just protect yourself
    

- ### amber _—_ Today at 11:54 AM
    
    i
    

- i said what i said because i know that you have difficulty sometimes with hearing about other people i'm with
    

### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 11:56 AM

I'd still rather you be honest. I really don't like being lied to. I'm sorry. My mind is already swirling about what other stuff could be a lie.

- It's like panic. I am sorry
    

- ### amber _—_ Today at 11:56 AM
    
    deep breaths
    

- would you like to call so i can provide some comfort and reassurance?
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 11:57 AM
    
    I'm not really sure if that would help. idk. Have fun. For real. It's important for you to get some good food. I just need some time I think
    

- ### amber _—_ Today at 11:58 AM
    
    may i say my peace before i head out then?
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 11:58 AM
    
    Okay
    

- ### amber _—_ Today at 12:08 PM
    
    okay so i was typing this whole time but i just realized that there is a glaring blind spot in my internal reasoning
    

- i want to come back to the full breakdown later
    

- so
    

- in the meantime
    

- i pinkie promise with a kiss that i have not lied about anything else
    

- it was absolutely wrong of me to do and i will not be lying about anything going forward, period
    

- because of my fucked up brain it really was just an isolated thing in my mind; i thought i was doing a good thing for you, but i am going to change
    

- sorry for getting all scrambled up
    

- it's hard to type on a phone
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 12:10 PM
    
    Okay. Thank you. I am sorry that I am distrustful and suspicious. :( That isn't fair to you. I just react really poorly to lying. I always have.
    

### amber _—_ Today at 12:10 PM

for me

hey

- hey
    

- hey
    

- no
    

- _i did a bad thing._
    

- i broke your trust
    

- that is a plain fact
    

- you did not react poorly at all
    

- honestly you reacted in a very understandable manner
    

- i don't want to go on a tangent but i've more or less just understood lying as being orders of magnitude less important than it actually is to everyone else, so the friction from me doing something like that to you is completely, completely understandable
    

- you reacted reasonably, calmly, and more generously than i might have deserved
    

i apologize, wholeheartedly

- you have been nothing but fair
    

- i promise
    

- pinkie promise
    

- with a kiss
    

- i want to make it up to you going forward and i will be doing everything i can to change and improve
    

- i'll go into more detail later
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 12:14 PM
    
    Okay. Mwaaah. With a kiss. Please just stay safe. Worried about you. I'll be here whenever you get home
    

- ### amber _—_ Today at 12:14 PM
    
    okay
    

- real quick, in an effort to make you less worried
    

we are only going to get lunch

- i am going to make sure of it
    

- i'm not going to let anything else happen
    

- you have my word
    

- i am driving to their place, going inside to let them know that i'm there, then they are getting in my car and i'm driving us to eat
    

### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 12:15 PM

Okay. I'll try my best to trust you. Although I am sure you understand why I am in a weird spot with that right now. I just want you to be happy healthy and safe. Guys can be dangerous after all.

- ### amber _—_ Today at 12:15 PM
    
    before i go, please ask any questions you have and raise any concerns. my primary focus right now is your emotional wellbeing, so even if you feel like it's silly, i wanna hear it
    

- it is completely understandable to feel uneasy with me. i can only apologize for the time being
    

- i will do my best to be safe
    

- and the guy is a "guy", which kind of makes it a touch safer haha
    

### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 12:17 PM

I admittedly don't have much more to add. Please don't get hurt, if anything goes wrong please be honest with that and tell me. Just worried about you, I tend to associate lying with people starting the path down risky behavior. I just want you in my life for as long as you want me in yours

- ### amber _—_ Today at 12:17 PM
    
    _hug_
    

- i'll keep you updated
    

- i can't promise as to the frequency, though
    

### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 12:18 PM

I know I am not expecting anything. Even if it's just letting me know what happened when you get back that's all I ask. I just don't want you to hide if something goes wrong from me

- ### amber _—_ Today at 12:18 PM
    
    and i know it's just words right now, but i want to change for the better and i want to _make it._ i am driven right now to have a long and happy life with you
    
- ### amber _—_ Today at 12:19 PM
    
    i can do that. if i somehow forget to do so, please remind me to give you the details of how it went once i am home
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 12:19 PM
    
    Okay. Thank you. I will remind you when you get home
    

### amber _—_ Today at 12:20 PM

okay so i'm actually having second thoughts about going over there now. haha

- i think this person might be assuming we will be having sex
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 12:21 PM
    
    I am sorry. I didn't mean to make you worry. Just be firm with your boundaries. Or do whatever you want to do. Just stay safe
    

- ### amber _—_ Today at 12:21 PM
    
    nono, they made me worry, not you

i think this resolves my worries

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 12:22 PM
    
    Oh that's good. I am glad that it worked out. I am glad you aren't in danger or anything. I love you
    

- ### amber _—_ Today at 12:22 PM

### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 12:22 PM

Okay. Have a good time. Talk to you tonight I suppose

### amber _—_ Today at 12:23 PM

- strictly answer based on your comfort
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 12:24 PM
    
    Huh, No? I am fine with you going. I want you to take care of yourself. I'll just also worry and miss you because that's the kind of girl I am lol
    

- ### amber _—_ Today at 12:24 PM
