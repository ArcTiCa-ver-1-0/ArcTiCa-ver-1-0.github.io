Problem:
- I am not setting a timer after taking my medicine
Potential solutions:
- Move the entire thing to shortcuts
- Move my entire life to timers again
	- This doesn't work in my depressive periods and I'd rather not commit to something this drastic that won't stick because I tend to delete things that I feel are pressuring me when I cannot meet them.
		- The same issue may apply to any potential solution.
			- ...Unless...
			- Instead of using default reminders, I use an automation reminder system which I can toggle depending on my Phase! ^phase
				- ... that definitely has potential. let's start with the MVP, though, as part of HOM, just to see how it goes.
- Set a reminder to start one after taking the med
	- this seems to be the MVP. i'll start here and adjust as needed .>>
		- actually just renamed the "med" in ios health to include the reminder. stumbled into the most elegant solution by doing <3
			- ... i've been thinking stuff like that a lot, recently. i wonder if it has a place in my theme/ [[6over8|religion]]...
	- do i trust myself to adjust as needed? .<<
		- yes, now that i stumbled into that elegant solution.
