# Good afternoon, computer.
I am feeling very mellow today.

-> [[an idea for my os]]
	- It would be nice to be able to link browser instances in here.
	- Headers should work the same as list items should work the same as any sort of bulleting as far as the keyboard is concerned
	- There should be a "right click" universal keyboard command

-> [[project ideas]]: Make an automatic changelog generator
	- for when people ask "what did you do today?"

~ ![[Inactive projects]]

~ ![[Things to learn]]

-> [[Challenge]]: thread this messaging sequence on a canvas:

    Hahahaha nice. We def need to do that
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 6:59 PM
    
    But it really fucking sucks she was treated that way
    

- I'm sorry
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 7:18 PM
    
    I wish I could do more for you today but I understand. Worried about you.
    

- ### amber _—_ Today at 7:19 PM
    
    doing better now
    

- got more high
    

- doing things
    

- ### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 7:19 PM
    
    what sorta things? I need to find my vape
    

- i found it it was in my sheets lol
    

- :( you're distant today. worried i've done something wrong. i know you said you'd let me know but... Like it's clear you want to talk to people just not me.
    
- ### amber _—_ Today at 7:26 PM
    
    i dont know how to answer this question
    

### amber _—_ Today at 7:26 PM

i am distant today

you have done nothing wrong

idu wym by > Like it's clear you want to talk to people just not me.

### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 7:26 PM

wdym you said you're doing things, so I wanted to know what things you are doing.

### amber _—_ Today at 7:27 PM

i find it hard to answer perfectly

typing on my computer, generally

i advanced my projects a little step each

### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 7:27 PM

I mean you sent a bunch of messages to that Sylvia person. So I just assumed you were talking lots

### amber _—_ Today at 7:27 PM

and modified a few files

### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 7:27 PM

Hell yeah! That is super cool! Awesome hacker girl stuff! So fucking cool

Super cool hacker girl

### amber _—_ Today at 7:28 PM

i find this an unreasonable conclusion to come to

the photos i sent you are evidence of my having sent exactly those messages

and it makes sense for me for one to not assume i have sent much more than those, given my tendency to be less social

__ in general, my social meter can be individualized

### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 7:31 PM

idk you're so cool and special and cute. I just assumed you were the sort of person to post on frengen and be super chatty. I'm sorry that is bad of me.

### amber _—_ Today at 7:31 PM

it is not bad of you

### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 7:31 PM

and that's where I assumed the sylvia person was from or something cuz trans girl

### amber _—_ Today at 7:31 PM

i understand the conclusion now

my conclusion was based on an understanding of my own tendencies in the area

an understanding which we have not yet had time to form

thank you for reminding me of this

:)

_ sylvia, my sister, is someone i met through an old friend

### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 7:32 PM

you just have a really beautiful soul

### amber _—_ Today at 7:33 PM

:)

### amber _—_ Today at 7:33 PM

>:)

### elleshellsbelles _—_ Today at 7:33 PM

My super cool hacker girl

### amber _—_ Today at 7:33 PM

<3

### amber _—_ Today at 7:34 PM
