what's even doing?
___
welcome to today.
- i suppose this is my god-ordained break or something.
	- in the grand scheme of things, what's a year off anyway? i've done a lot in my life already.
- i have an idea for a game.
	- my neighbor is the protagonist.
		- i like the idea of them giving you the same gift every day to grind up your friendship level or something.
			- maybe we explore free will and the like. who knows.
	- rune factory rip off seems fun.
- dawn and i aren't going to be a thing anymore.
	- we both still love each other.
	- i'd been feeling about how it does seem like she is so much more adult than me. this kind of confirms it.
		- she said that we aren't in the same place in life, which, yeah.
	- i'm liking ellie more.
		- i was worried that i'd fall out after the bpd honeymoon, but no. it's all good. and she seems to be adapting well, too.
		- kind of resolves the worry i had about who to choose, in the end.
		- i suppose we should address this in our next review.
		- i really need her to go to therapy. i hope she has good insurance.
- went into the new job today for orientation, but they needed my physical ID, so i'll have to come back next week.
	- procrastinator's gamble punished.
		- thought about reorganizing my car days ago but decided not to because of the rain and just inertia.
			- i'll probably do it today since i took a vyvanse.
				- let's see if it's raining....
					- not now, and probably not until the evening, but i'll play it safe. it is everything i own, after all.
						- not that i'm one for owning much.
			- it would be so much easier if there were a convenient place to put the things, but it is what it is.

gonna use the bathroom. brb.

- let's transfer the iOS Reminders tasks into here.
	- [x] dompiredone
		- googling...
			- [...] is used [off label](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_label "Off label") to induce and promote [breast milk production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation "Lactation") [...]
				- i'm good, lol
	- [<] look into proxy tourneys
		- regarding [[MtG]]
			- more generally, i want to get into more social activities. [[Smash]] would be fine, and i've thought about getting into [[skating]].
				- joining a [[DnD]] group could also be fun!
				- but the goal is to just be social.
					- where to start?
						- well, i can't do too much in person right now since i don't have gas money, unfortunately. pretty much every social thing i would wanna do requires travel since we are in the middle of nowhere....
	- [x] Provide love to Ellie [daily]
		- i think i'll write out something nice for her :)
			- i love you so much. all of you. all of your imperfections and beautiful perfections. i am so, so happy that i am able to love you and grow with you and learn with you. you are a treasure i cannot be without and you mean the world to me <3
	- [x] Update my mailing address
		- [x] dunno if i can do this without a permanent address. i'll just ask [[Ellie's mom]] if its okay.
	- [x] Listen to Sylvia's song
		- she sent this a while back on [[Discord]]. lemme find it...
			- K Flay - Sister
				- when she said it was poppy trash, she wasn't lying, haha. not the current vibe, but i can appreciate it. something to make me think of her `<3`
	- [<] get windshield fixed before winter
		- this will simply need to be part of the [[Budget|budget]] once i start working.
	- [<] Remind Ellie to practice [daily]
		- it might be easier to encourage her to do this once we get into a routine.
			- speaking of, i wanna start going to the gym....
				- it'll be easier to start when i'm not working, so maybe i ought to go tomorrow.
				- i told ellie to force me to come with her when she next goes.
					- texted, anyway. she should see it when her game ends.
			- scheduled it for [[Saturday, September 1st, 2024 - Logfile|the first of September]] since idk· when her classes start.
	- [<] Find my ID
		- gonna do this [[Saturday, August 10th, 2024 - Logfile|this weekend]] since it's wet out
	- [>] Call insurance
		- asked dad for the number
	- [>] move banks
		- [[Ellie's mom]] mentioned [[Lanco]], a local credit union.
			- asking her if it's in town...
	- [<] orientation [[Tuesday, August 13th, 2024 - Logfile|Tuesday at 3p·]]
	- and i'm just gonna add
		- [x] get a text expander
			- this reminds me that i wanna do stuff with nix at some point. automate everything and whatnot.
				- wanted to, anyway, but now i think its best to just build up a system over time.
			- added [[espanso]], gonna reboot and try it...
				- but of course, on [[NixOS]], it's never that simple...
					- guess i'm making my own.
						-> [[Text expander]]
		- [<] clean the room
			- or at least my stuff in it.
			- kind of hard to do with so little space...
				- i'll probably be able to do better if i can salvage a container after i reorganize the car
- been a long time since i've been [[Waiting in the rain]]
- the wifi here is pretty mid
- i'm excited for the future `:)` ellie is gonna be working the [[Ren Faire]], which sounds so fun. we are gonna have our own place and i'm gonna be working for good money ($15 an hour!) for whatever i want!
- oh, i guess eventually i'll wanna register to vote. it can wait until we have our place.

time for dinner.
- i'm honestly not that hungry, but [[Ellie|her]] parents worry about me, so i like them to see me eating.
	- forgot that vyvanse makes my appetite disappear `xp`

- finally took the PS4 games listing down and deleted Facebook Messenger.
	- i ought to ask about the money i'm owed...
- i'm worried that i won't find my driver's license. it would be a real hassle if i lost it.
	- i'm sure it'll be fine, though. absolute worst case scenario is that i have to pay express shipping on it.
- ellie seems to be having fun playing DnD `:)`
	- she was feeling a bit sick earlier, so i'm happy to see her in better spirits.

[[Yoko]] just sent me a friend request.
...Very strange.
Probably bad news.
- Shades of [[Cameron]] back in Freshman year of high school.
- i'll tell ellie when her game is done, for honesty's sake.
Let's see how this goes.
- doesn't seem to be bad news, so that's a relief.
Seems like they're not typing anymore.
- they said they were just checking to ensure i'm okay because they hadn't seen me on social media in a while. they also cleared the air a bit and said they intend on talking more one day.
	- pretty much best case scenario, i'd say.

> dnd is such a cool artform. i remember being in such awe of my past dm·s and their adaptability in storytelling

i think i'll call it here on productivity for today. a very good session, i'd say, and a good start to the week to come.
- time to love on ellie! `<3`
