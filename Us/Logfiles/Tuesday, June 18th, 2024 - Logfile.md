- not a lot of working going on, but that's okay. perhaps i ought to take this time to do other intentional things which are not work.
	- might as well finish off the tasks first, though.
		- [[Task cards.canvas]]
			- on [[mood tracking]]:
				- this is something i wanna do multiple times a day, ideally. i could tie it to meds.
					- [x] let's put a sticky note by them
					- #review
