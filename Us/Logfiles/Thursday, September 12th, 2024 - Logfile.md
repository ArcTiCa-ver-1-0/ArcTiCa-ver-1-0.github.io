"what am i doing?"
don't wanna rush! don't wanna waste time!
"what is the point?"
!!
___
just pick one that seems reasonable and go for it
maybe there is no resolution to the paradoxes. we just tend to avoid them and that's that. no limit ad absurdium, no event horizon, just plain old probability distributions and bounce backs.
i guess its probably fine to wish for there to be more humans. things tend to get better over time and there tend to be more people over time. but at that point, is it really a wish? seems more an inevitability.
you should wish, then, for something which is likely not to happen. like, i wish to live a really long time. i probably won't live a really long time.

little piles of dust in my wake

ideally i spend tomorrow library hopping. in-built break time and all. idk. need to get up for now. ciao, library.

hello, other library. teehee. might send cgpt my boilerplate and see if it can handle the camera stuff with pygame.
- so i mean, it did, but i let it use the not implemented stuff, so like, i didn't really get anything out of it haha
	- i think this is just a sign that i'm burnt out for the day lol
i want attention. i miss having friends.
i wanna play pokemon. those games are pretty. `:3`
- should i play red and stuff again? i technically didn't finish it...
	- maybe just yellow. hehe
i'm gonna do a factory reset on my deck. need to free up space.
can u put a website on github..?
so much thinking in circles

i think i'm getting ready to close out this vault. it was made by a person who doesn't exist anymore and i hardly ever need anything from the backlog nowadays.
i feel very separated from that person and her world. unfortunately. or maybe not unfortunately.
idk.
i am who i am now and i am where i am now.
weird given that its been only a few months. but. its been a long few months.
kinda.
shrug.

am i still Us?
i
dont know
tbh.

am i the same person that dawn left?
..yes, but better..? kind of?
...

maybe i move to louisville
somewhere on the outskirts, but close to old louisville.
im supposed to wait until things settle down, but they wont settle down until i pick a place to settle.
im not attached to anywhere atm. so
might as well just cut out as many middle steps as i can, yeah?

idk

nothing doing at this very moment

i guess i sleep on it, see what comes. for the time being, im completely okay and will be until winter.
two months of leeway.
two months...
longer than i spent in pennsylvania.
ha

no use planning right now, though.

ugh.
