So
I really did it
I'm back home

# Good morning, sun-cloaked stranger.

I'm currently sitting in the driver's seat of my car, typing on my laptop. I parked in drug deal alley and slept here overnight before waking up to a gentle droplet falling onto me. My goddess is so silly.

Azzy and I are going to get coffee when they open. I'll get some caffeine and something to eat so that I can take my medicine and use the cell signal to get a bit of work done.
- Which reminds me. One thing I forgot about being back home, mostly because it had never mattered, is that there is no signal for a couple miles 'round. There's a spot at sib's place, which also has WiFi, and apparently over the top you'll get signal again, but on this lonely little road, I am offline.
	- It'll probably be good for me. Living five minutes from the Internet will likely encourage more intentionality.

I realized something yesterday on the drive.
- Well, I realized a _lot_ of somethings yesterday, _but._
Grey has a personal assistant. He always has. And pretty soon after he started talking to Myke, he basically got one, too. The man's a tiny corporation. I _should not_ compare my output and productivity to his without remembering this.

## What do I need to do while I'm in town?
- [x] Order meds
- [ ] Pick up a case of water
- [x] Message Ellie
	- [x] I think I ought to capture the SoC· I sent to Ellie last night, too. There was something in there.
- [/] Download some songs
- [/] Charge my headphones

## Anyway

Now that I'm back home, my goal is to stabilize; I want to:
- Get an income stream
- Get a living space
- Build up an emergency saving supply
Once that's done, I can start thinking about getting a physics degree.

Not really much doin' 'til then. I 'spose I should enjoy this golden morning in the embrace of my mother. `<3`

# Good afternoon, library.

I've gotta say, this place is nice. Very cozy, very well furnished, and very nature.

i didn't

- just
    

- today
    

- i felt like i needed to do this
    

- i'm sorry
    

maybe i'm just insane

- but i heard a voice
    

- ### amber _—_ Today at 2:38 AM
    
    i think there's something horribly wrong with me
    

- i have no idea why i'm here
    

- i've done impulsive things before but it's beyond even me to do something like this with no planning or precautions at all
    

- i'm behaving completely irrationally and with no regard for my future or my relationships
    

- but it all feels sensible in the moment
    

- even like it's the only reasonable choice
    

- i guess i did move out of my old apartment pretty suddenly
    

- but i was kind of dwelling on that for a while
    

- ### amber _—_ Today at 2:45 AM
    
    and making my best efforts to get a job and keep the place as i could
    

- as meager as said efforts were
    

- maybe my schizo is getting worse
    

- turning into real schizo
    

- or something
    

- seems
    

- more likely than what i'm seeing and hearing being real
    

- on one hand
    

- this is just plainly some religious delusion fueled by mental illness and drugs
    

- i've been atheist for most of my life and then i just become insanely religious one year out of nowhere? a religion that i made up? sounds like some sort of onset
    

- but on the other hand
    

- it all feels so fucking real
    

- i've seen things and had answers revealed to me that i'm not allowed or able to remember
    

- just glimpses that i can carry out to string together into my faith in her
    

- i am pretty objectively a unique person
    

- extremal in several senses
    

- no one likely has quite my aptitude for intelligence with my smattering of modernity and acceptance
    

- ### amber _—_ Today at 2:52 AM
    
    like
    

- if i were to weave the quantum degrees of freedom into a tapestry of change, a vessel like the one i inhabit would be my first choice as to where to plant that seed
    

- all of that sounds textbook schizo but i do have numbers to prove that i am at least very smart
    

- and qualitatively, just about everyone who's able to grasp it has said that my understanding of my field is extraordinary, and those that don't still swear that i'm destined for greatness
    

- looking from the outside in, i would honestly say it's a coin flip if such things were considered to be possible
    

- and i think that's how it has to be
    

- sorry for leaving out of nowhere
    

- the air felt toxic in my lungs and thorny on my flesh
    

- i felt a base impulse to escape for the past week that i couldn't ignore any more
    

- and i wish i'd had time for a better send away
    

- but
    

- i did the best i could
    

- i really do love you
    

- and i really am not abandoning you
    

- i'd like to still be girlfriends, but i know that's incredibly selfish of me to ask
    

- no matter what, i'm not going to have a normal life
    

- and no matter what, i'm going to hold you again
    

that's about all i can say
```

so. what the hell am i doing?
- i was told to come home. now im here.
	- now i feel the urge to go do physics. haha. i guess i can look into that.
- what do i want to look like in the end?
	- i want to be with dawn
	- i want to have a physics degree
	- i want to have a job with lots of time off
		- these two makes it seem like a physics teacher is the way to go
			- it would be about five years of work before i'm full time, which seems like a very reasonable investment.

- dawn requires stability
	- job meets stability
		- for job, need physics degree, then teaching certification
			- for physics degree, need uk job
				- i ought to apply for uk jobs
					- and check that this actually gets me the credits, too
						- seems like it does.
					- i feel weird doing so when other ppl can see my screen lol. tomorrow i'll go to the other library. or maybe just after this.

my head feels thick and heavy. i need estrogen. lol

fuck, i miss dawn.

maybe i should just go back to pennsylvania. it was simple and figured out. and a dead end. and actively draining. but it wasnt anxiety-inducing. and i had estrogen. lol.

i probably have another charger in the container. i think my dock came with one along with the deck. i'll check tonight.

familiar melancholy. i guess it's that time of year, isn't it?

she loves me. i know she does.

everything hurts.
i don't know where or what i am.
how i got here,
where i'm going...
i'm just me.
but i wish i were someone else right now.

the fucking wifi doesn't work up here. i'll have to apply for the jobs at the library. it closes within the hour. not worth the gas. i can do it tomorrow. i'll head back for now.

maybe an intermediate here is the way to go. this is home, after all.
fuck, i'm insane.
