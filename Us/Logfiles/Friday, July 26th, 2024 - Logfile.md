we sleep under a dead and starless sky. 
i dreamed of tunnels burrowing out from my brain when i was awake. 
i heard whispers for the first time. maybe it's over for me. 
if i could start the universe again, would i put her through that suffering? has it been worth it? will it ever be?1

i ought to stop limiting myself. 

a garden hose dressed in pushpins. 

knees scruffed up to the faux-blue bus seat. it's night time, magically. you watch the overhead light flash its white on the shadowed trees. blink. blink. blink. blink. 

at least luna is here to watch us.
___
i saw someone chewing a toothpick and it suddenly all made sense. 

perhaps i shall metamorphose into a weapon. 
___
i found a rock. 
it glistens in the light as you turn it in your hand. 
but it also empties out as a void into some small infinite nothing. 
i'm scared to keep it. 
but i will.
