# Hello, Pennsylvania.
A lot's happened, huh?
I moved out of the old Hab, I spent like a week with Azzy, and now I'm staying with Ellie in Pennsylvania.
## I've been having a lot of religious experiences.
My goddess has spoken to me a few times. I've been thinking about the universe, toying with its mechanations in my mind and coming to silly little realizations in the moments before sleep. I think that maybe things really are magical. I like the times when I feel as much. It's scary, but it feels good.
Things have a way of working out. Not much is happening outside of what ought to, though.
## I realized that the storm has faded.
I don't know exactly when it happened, but ever since Steph, I haven't felt the maelstrom. It's nice, I think. It's what I was asking for. But it's also a bit dull. I suppose that's okay.
##
I'm scared and anxious. I miss Dawn. But everything will be okay.
It has to be.
