went to the gym today. burned a lot of calories, apparently.
- my head feels empty. hopefully it gets easier with time.
	- this place is thick, visceral, and gloomy. i don't like it in the least. but the company's good.
		- shades of my sibling breathing in moss
- what to do with my time?
	- drink in the proportions and sup of raw humanity on the aggregate, i suppose.
- had an idea for a game. it'll stick with me, i bet.
- my vault is in a comical disarray. i really like it, honestly. i might take a snapshot and share it somewhere. could be a fun little game.
