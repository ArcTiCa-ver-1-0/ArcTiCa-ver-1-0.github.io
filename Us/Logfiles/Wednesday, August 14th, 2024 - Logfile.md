swaying is so fun
anyway, first day of work
___
how can i make life easier for future me?
- get gas
	- perhaps bring up in conversation to ellie's parents your desire to drive her
		- [x] set a reminder
		- is this ethical?
			- i think that this is a bit of a half truth. saying explicitly that you would appreciate the gas money so that you can get to work as well is more ethical.
				- [x] modify reminder
- move insurance card into a more convenient spot
	- [x] set a reminder
- remember to set up a physical inbox
	- i wonder if ellie's mom would be okay with me using her desk if i promise to get everything put back together once i am done
		- [x] ask her
what a productive question
how can i make life happier for future me?
- i'm thinking along the lines of "replace x with y"
	- i wanna get rid of some media consumption
		- but what to add in?
			- perhaps tech-free time in the park
				- but what about when it rains?
				- [x] set a reminder to start a habit
i like how this quite naturally resulted in short, mid, and long term thing(s)
anyway, i'm gonna go to the park and then take a shower.
