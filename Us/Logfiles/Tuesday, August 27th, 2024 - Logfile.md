hello, my cozy little laptop.
- thinking about what it means to be and to change.
	- different aspects or different beings?
		- was it there all along, waiting to be expressed, or was it conjured of the moment? nay, perhaps it was the culmination of everything i have been, tracing out a spiral going up a vase as i age.
- i am a constellation.
i think that i need to leave ellie for her to change.
- ive taught her what i know. now its up to her to practice it.
