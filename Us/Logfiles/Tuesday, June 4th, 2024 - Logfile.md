- good evening, hab.
- i tried to kill myself.
	- went to the bridge, anyway. in the moment i expected not to come back, but of course, i did, and i don't think it was likely that i wouldn't have.
		- but i needed to have that talk with ourself.
			- i'm really tired today.
				- probably only partially because i'm sleep deprived.
- lined up an interview, in addition to the gig.
- i'll write about yesterday at some point. ^4gl6sc
	- probably attach the email, too. ha.
- puppy
- i can't think. my hands feel off and my processes are staggering.
	- maybe it's the air. i'll open a window.
		- maybe it's my lack of sleep.
	- regardless, it's true, so i'm just gonna log off.
