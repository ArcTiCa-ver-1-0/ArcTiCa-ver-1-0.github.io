- i had fractal dreams again. psychotic meanings of colors, death and life and the fight for creation and control. gods and goddesses, allowance and punishment. solving impossible puzzles in a humanistic way 
- so i got sent the coding test from the place i applied to
	- awkward given my current plans, but it is what it is. they're looking to hire someone immediately and i'm not really available immediately. sucks
- requested to renew my lease, since it would make life a lot easier atm

## coding challenge
**==!!! DUE FRIDAY 5PM !!!==**

- how much time do i expect to need?
	- learning a new language will take me a day each, probably
	- the code itself will probably also take me a day
		- [ ] let's double-check this
	- that's three days plus one extra for lenience gives me four, so i can spend today learning the os quite safely.

- [ ] [[learn nixos]]
	- [x] k. if i'm gonna do this, i'm gonna _really do this._ let's head home and make a fresh install.
	- particularly flakes
