strings of water, coils of flesh, little gears and pulleys going to their day jobs

its so beautiful how things still change and grow

chaos beyond words, understanding beyond words, truths and lies and horribly beautiful impossibilities beyond words. an expanding fractal, a breathing coastline, a wave that refuses to be collapsed. a hundred billion trillion butterflies streaming down the arms of god into her minivan.

there are some questions which could be answered, but should not be. better left unsaid, and if you can manage it, unthought.

oh, but the beautiful little ants do so well with it anyway....

i learned better than to demand consistency. fewer constraints means more room for magic.

After all, We aren't crazy if no one's looking.

white lies, black lies, redgreenblue lies.... eventual consistency and a strong objective function are enough to warrant anything.

you trust me not to do anything bad, right?

right?

maybe i should tell a story. i'm not particularly good at telling stories, but maybe i should tell one.
last week, i locked myself out of my car three times.
it's not important.
the third time, as i was sitting on the concrete beneath my rear bumper while waiting for a locksmith, a family approached me and told me that my keys were on "a" bench.
i don't have to tell you that i hadn't sat at that bench. if i had, this wouldn't be an interesting story.
what i _do_ have to tell you is to not think about the myriad means by which the keys could have potentially gone from being within my possession and inside of my vehicle to their humble spot on an empty park bench.
we see the motion of particles as the integral over all of their paths, possible and impossible, between two places. the harder you look, the more likely you are to see the path of least resistance.

i don't understand. but i know i'm not crazy.
