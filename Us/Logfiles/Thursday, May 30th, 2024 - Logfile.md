today has been really nice :) i did a good job and its been happy cozy hopeful dreaming <3 We are gonna make it.
i cared about Us :)

[[gossamer thoughts]]

oh! i watched the first episode of Murder Drones! it was _really_ good. the characters are all super cute and fill me with so much happy gender feelings. the style somehow enhances the sharpness of the action, and the humanity of everything makes me feel so comfy. the cringe actually became endearing and i laughed quite a few times <3 looking forward to watching the next episode tomorrow! -uzi

i wonder if i can use symlinks or tags to better sort my vault. some things could be under both learning and creation, for example.

maybe i ought to start again in a new vault. im not arctica, after all. ^r9fh76

...ill archive this one, of course.

...

maybe today is a new day.

hello, world. its Us.

i had a lot of bad dreams last night. betrayal, insecurity, violation... dreams are scary. im glad that We will always have each other <3

- [x] set up daily notes
- [x] set up obsidian theme

i like the idea of my theme being [[Alone, Together]]. short and succinct; no preamble needed.

ive been sitting here for a minute but i dont know that there's anything left to do. of course, as always, there will be in the future; ive got an interview this sunday, and [[Spaceship You|the ship]] requires constant maintenance. however, i have made my effort today. We did good <3

if this is the last i write in this logfile, then its been wonderful speaking with You, whoever You may be. i know the transition between vaults makes things a little bit bumpy, but thank you for sticking with me. here's to a better future <3
