- hello, library. i feel great today!

# Review of yesterday
- i took a nice long walk in the park last night well after sundown. of course, no one was there, which in it of itself made the experience much more pleasurable and liberating, but also the sundowned scene of fireflies and cicada cries was unlike what i have been in before at that location. that location being the arboretum. i got lost in the woods for a bit, which was fun, and then walked the full path circle, taking in the swaying leaves overlaying grey clouds overlaying a conservative spray of stars. i had quite a few interesting switches, if youd call them that, some of which would make me seem insane to an onlooker. but there were no onlookers. it was only me. it was only Us.
	- speaking of, we aren't really Us right now. not as strongly as we were before. that's okay; it's natural. but of course, i want to become more like that again.
- i thought a bit about some of my goals on my misdirected drive.
	- in the short term, i want to get this job, which means my working hours should be devoted towards that.
	- in the mid term, i want to get psychiatric treatment, which at current i will consider having work a prerequisite for.
	- in the long term, 
		- yes, in the long term. that is the real question. something worth thinking on heavily.
			- "set your goal as universal happiness and pray to god it is never achieved"
				- during my wanderings, i thought that little phrase after toying with the "universe full of pleasured brains" scenario that i often consider. it came about from the realization that long term goals don't necessarily have to be a desirable end result as long as heading in their direction is beneficial and you have the ability to change your goals as you see fit.
					- changing your own goals. what a delightfully human concept.
				- perhaps, given that, there is a better way to phrase it, but it is biting and pointed and hooks a reader's attention, i think.
				- i also really like the term "universal happiness" as it calls to mind "universal paperclips" and seems at first aligned with the human directive, more or less. however, as conversations have revealed, the concept comes with a hefty lot of unease and fear, which i find so very interesting, hence the second part.
- as far as work, i got php working and loaded up a generated page on localhost in the evening. most of the day was spent messing with gnome and learning nix and its os, but those are indeed prerequisites to serious development.
	- i was quite pleased with my ability to redirect myself back on topic when necessary, leaving certain trails unfollowed, but towards the end, perhaps naturally, i became quite scatterbrained. i think today i ought to try out using short timers to briefly interrupt myself with the directive to think on what my current intent is. this bit of mindfulness should be beneficial, i think.
		- [ ] set up intentionality reminders
- mood was quite chaotic yesterday.
	- i found myself simultaneously energized and depressed, a state consequential of my unique inbuilt imbalances and my regimental supplementation. this perhaps proves, as if proof were necessary, that my current cocktail is subpar, and gives an extra bit of weight to my consideration of lithium.
		- speaking of, given my current working outlook, i think that i will be in outpatient for some time before committing to an inpatient stay. perhaps standard psychiatry and therapy as a start once i have the structure and funding.
			- speaking of funding, the thought of finally having a steady income with which to budget is really exciting. i truly am a nerd.
- on taking care of myself:
	- i perhaps over-ate, but it is hard to tell with my regular appetite suppression. it is good that i am feeding myself, regardless.
	- i showered in the evening, which was perhaps overdue, but i do what i can, and it was good.
	- i cleaned a good bit around my office.
		- i want to reorganize my furniture when i have the short term work to spare since i will be here for a while.
			- and, oh yes! i requested to renew my lease. that adds a bit of undue(?) anxiety to my life, but i'm sure it will all work out.
- my relationships are not really all there at the moment. when i have the time to spare, i ought to make an intentional effort to forge new physical connections.
- i think i might benefit from re-reading some of my old compositions. forge in particular.
- i think that i should consider more intentional recreation, perhaps in the exploration genre. there truly is so much to learn and customize and create.
- arctica cant comprehend love
___

- gonna call my review there. i've things to do today!
	- first up, to check my email. .>>
		- ah, right. need to connect to the wifi.
			- screw it, too much to learn right now. i'll check it on my phone.
		- ooh, a new interview. i'll call and set that up tomorrow.
	- next, since i don't have wifi, i'm gonna head home and work on the coding test.
