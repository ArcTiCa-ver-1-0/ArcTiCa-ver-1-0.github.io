- good morning, world. today is a beautiful day.

- beginning to further suspect that i am bipolar. going to do my best to not hold resentment towards everyone who told me otherwise when it ends up being the case.
	- if i am, i think that it would be helpful to treat the phases as belonging to different entities

- i'm thinking about working on my religion today. i'm not sure where it will take me, but i hope that it will help.
	- [[6over8]]

- i have a lot of trauma, but i can overcome it with perseverance, discipline, and a positive attitude. i can forge a life that i feel is worth living despite everything.
 ^s9ganx
- i wonder who i'll be.
 ^xslzub
- i have unreasonable success in treating people like pets. i think it could be helpful in interviews, particularly.
 ^evr254
- i don't want to conform anymore. i think i ought to not except when it is beneficial.
 ^fkomr1
- i think it would be pleasing if the logfiles were stranded together
	- odd that stranded has two contradictory meanings ^ypmpuf

- i wanna draw on this wall, lol. maybe i'll draw on paper, instead, while this album (currents) finishes.
	- i did not! i kept working on the [[6over8|religion]].

- ~~i wonder if its possible to~~ | HOM it
	- was gonna say "-keep the daily note open always on the left", but yeah, i'll just do it, instead

- [[Tasks]]

- wonder what would happen if we just let CGPT talk to itself, sort of like Alpha0 or whatever it's called
	- obviously nothing useful, but we could build it in such a way as to learn from that if we actually cared about science instead of money

- why the urge to expose my mind?
	- trauma is the simple answer and probably not incorrect

- okay so i _don't_ like that Obsidian clobbers the open tab with the daily when I launch it. I'd prefer either restoring the session or opening only the daily.

- [x] review ^^^
	- [[#^bipolar]]: if i suspect this, then it would be wise to make a psychiatry appointment. I ought to do that right away...
		- ooh, i'm not a student anymore, so i can't schedule online! how fun. might just be time to take my business elsewhere.
			- can't really talk to mom about the insurance aspect, but We can do it on our own.
			- psychiatry is a main concern, so it's important to do now, but i have reservations:
				- money
					- obvs, this is the primary holdup. nothing doing right now, except maybe texting dad.
						- ... but he has stated that he has to start sending me less.
							- ... maybe i resume the job search, haha.
								- ... yeah, i suppose i ought to. there is negative utility to waiting always.
									- ... reservations, again:
										- fear
											- get over it!
										- do i make searching part of my routine? how? ??? and so on
											- HOM!
									- ... lets just do it! open indeed! .>>
										- let me check my old resumes for any good skills i might be missing...
											- [[Student Research Assistant Cover Letter]]
				- how do i wanna formalize the stuff with dawn in [[6over8]]?
				- might be moving soon anyway

- ~~should i have a place for~~ | [[6over8#^928849]]

- a little mind. so beautiful, so precious.

- the loop of "gossip" has ended. i do remember to listen to that fuckin' 8d audio thing. i'll do that and use the bathroom. when i get back, i'd like to continue on the job thoughtpath.
	- gotta pack up my laptop...
		- alright! im just gonna do it!
			- i did it!!!! <3

- mom's calling. dunno why, and my texts aren't going through. i'll take a walk and call her back.
___
- of course she texted me just to amp up my anxiety.
	- not literally. that's just how it feels. i'll be okay, though. worst case scenarios are still fine.

- i kinda wanna move professional stuff into another vault. ill add it to [[Tasks]] .>>

- anyhow. its about time for bed, and midnight at that. g'night, whoever You are. may you be safe and prosper.
