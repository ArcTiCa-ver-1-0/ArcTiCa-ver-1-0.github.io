- nothin' particularly on the mind this morning. i had an energy shot and then my vyvanse like an hour later and it feels pretty chill. felt some pressure in the head while i was taking the test but no pain or anything. honestly i feel really calm and collected. this might be the wave.
	- unless the depression comes back, in which case it is less likely to be the wave.
