```

```

Lie, get away with it ~== Tell the truth
Lie, get caught > Negative reaction to truth

However! You still must obviously deal with the consequences of the truth!!!
```

perhaps the goal is to protect her from the (potential) hurt of the truth.

## Childhood perspective

- Truth => Punishment
- Lie, fail => Punishment[^aside]
- Lie, success => No punishment

The obvious difference here is that this is a one-player game and trying to generalize this to me trying to help other people (or postpone difficulty for myself) is genuinely counterproductive.

Lying is only optimal when there is no two-way relationship, or the questioner has an unchanging perception of the agent.

[^aside]: Allegedly, the punishment would be more harsh if the agent was caught in a lie as opposed to telling the truth. However, this did not end up being the case for several reasons.

- wanna formalize that [[#^bd6f15]] is shorthand for "this is basically scratch paper, so things will be incorrect andor incomplete"

# Moving forward
## I need to...
- [ ] do for her what i would want her to do for me
## I ask of you...
- forgive small missteps? i dont lie about big things anymore, i dont think
	- well, the psychosis bit
		- that is wrapped up in mother, so its complicated. #review
