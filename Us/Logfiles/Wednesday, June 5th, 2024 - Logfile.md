	- god im so nervous. scared? worried that i'll come up short and be seen as inadequate.
		- i'll do well, though. i believe in us. we got this.
___
- i wonder how things are gonna go when im working full time. im not gonna have long to do things at home, which will be difficult, but i think i will manage. just remember to stay in the present and do the most important things first.
- [x] speaking of important things, i have many overdue ios reminders. let's check on those.
	- [x] [[Tasks]].add
- i dont like that i just eat all the snacks i have as soon as i get them. even when unlimited in supply, my body will not learn that it is okay and that i can slow down. maybe i ought to get that checked out.

- sitting here, zoning out. it's 7pm on a wednesday.
	- do i need to be in the library?
		- not if i'm not working on anything.
			- but i should be working.
				- why do you say that?

						- there are always things to be done.
					- because i'm scared of not doing enough
						- anything in specific?
							- i'm worried about my financial and living situation
								- finances are being patched up as we speak
								- living situation is resolving itself nicely, though we ought to look for apartments soon, as well as consider our means of paying the front cost.
									- however, that is not urgent on the order of today. you had an interview, got set up with well-paying gig work, and prepared for yet another interview while on your day off. we talked to zeke about him helping us with the moving. you fed yourself.
										- if there is one thing you could still do today, it is hygiene. other than that, you have done more than enough. i promise. <3

													- `<3`
