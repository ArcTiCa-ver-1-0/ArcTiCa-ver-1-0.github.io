# Good morning, library.

I'm going slow today.

Intentionality.

Transferred the animation script onto the laptop. It's running right now. Seems to be working.
- I wanna get type hinting.

But first, I have to figure out my living situation.
- It could be up to six weeks before I hear back regarding the UK job. This tells me that I need to do something in the meantime.
	- Roughly speaking, there are four possible options:
		- Louisville
		- Lexington
		- Hazard
		- Missouri
	- Of these, Hazard and Lexington stand out:
		- Hazard:
			- My favorite
			- Beautiful
			- Calm
			- Close to Kacey
			- Low cost of living
			- Might be difficult to find a place
			- Few indoor places to spend a lot of time in
		- Lexington:
			- I'm already here
			- Where I want to end up for the next large step
			- A library I can spend all day in, most of the time
			- High cost of living
			- Choked
			- Parking is an issue
	- Louisville and Missouri are effectively dominated by these two.
	- Given that I've already done and failed a lot of job hunting in Lexington, I am leaning towards Hazard. However, I will consider the place I happened upon. I suppose I ought to give that number a call to see what the rent is like.

It seems like there is nowhere to live in Hazard. I'll likely be staying in Lexington for now. I suppose now I look for more jobs.
Groan.
e jobs.
Groan.
On the bright side, the only urgency is getting _some_ job. I can live out of my car pretty much indefinitely. The only constraint is food, which I have a pretty healthy amount of money left for.

Might go visit Sylvia. If I'm doing that, then I should pause for a bit.
