- [x] gotta make the properties automatic. [[Tasks]].add
___
- good morning, library.
- pulled an all-nighter.
	- decided to skip my vyvanse yesterday since it was my day off and mostly because i didn't want to cook because i was out of food except for rice. that didn't go well because i started feeling like shit so at like 5pm i decided to cook the rice but then it got fucked up for various reasons so i got takeout -- later than i should have, since it was raining -- and then took the thing. couldn't or didn't want to sleep, so yeah, here i am. let's get this bread.
- wanna do job app stuff first. at least a unit.
	- mcdonald's rescheduled my interview AGAIN so that fucking chugs. i ought to apply to some other part time places, i guess. i'm basically out of money and have to get the vyvanse refilled soon. i thought about going back to subway since they don't hate me and it was easy with lots of spare time.
		- [x] i guess i ought to do that first. subway
			- they're closed, lol. whatever. i want to focus on bigger jobs right now, anyway, since mom hates me.
				- i'm splitting.
					- she is very frustrated with me.
				- [x] let's go on indeed
					- holy fuck my soul is destroyed and my mind is burned
						- [x] no more. please go home
___
- forget everything. i am nothing.
	- what are you? what do you want?
		- i am nothing. i don't know what i want.
