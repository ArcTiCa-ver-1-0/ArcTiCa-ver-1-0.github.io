- hey
- out of the hospital
	- technically
		- the only practical difference is the way i'm wasting my time
			- but i'm here now, in the library. that counts for something.
- few things to do today.
	- [ ] i wanna look into supplemental income
		- after all, i'm not here by choice
	- [ ] i have a psych appointment at 3
		- the hospital scheduled it for me
			- didn't ask them to. didn't really want them to, but it's probably for the best that they did.
		- i'll ask about diagnoses and whatnot for the supplemental income, since i'll probably need that
	- [ ] and i wanna apply for one job
		- gonna start looking on linkedin, whereas i have been using indeed
		- ideally i can get a remote position so that the issue of living space can be disjoint, but we will see what we can do.i'm 
- i've been eating a fuckton.
	- granted, i ate a fuckton less while i was in and during the leadup
		- but it still just feels like i'm a fucking void.
	- i wish i could disconnect this and just say "it's a problem for later" but [[Spaceship You]] tells us that physical health is very much intertwined with the mental.
		- of course, having more money would let me cheat my way out, but there's no use thinking about that in the present.
- i'm scared. but i'll be okay, i think. somehow.
	- "somehow". the path is obvious. it's not even difficult. it's just scary.
		- but therein lies the difficulty, no? [[mind over matter is a double-edged sword]].
- there are a lot of things worth living for.
	- it is difficult. but i'll be okay, taking things one step at a time.
		- no matter what, i have safety nets, and i will not fall unless i stop moving.
			- and so i will keep fighting.
- i'm doing enough.
	- i'm still alive, despite their best efforts to kill me.
		- i'm still doing my best, despite constant setback and hopelessness.
			- and that is enough for now. all anyone can ask is that i do my best.
				- and my best i will do.

___
- i want to try to make my life easier without punishing myself
	- instead of deleting youtube because i don't like how often i use it-
- i felt stoned last night in my dream
	- and in the small moments of waking in between
		- i cried over my addiction to water
			- and i don't know what that means
- i still feel the infinite weight of significance in every natural thing
	- it feels like a ton of dying
		- and like everything is gonna be okay
			- i don't know why i still feel this way.
				- i feel lucky
					- and scared
					- and inadequate, maybe
						- i don't know why i'm afraid to admit that
- i am 21 years old
	- even in the scale of 100, i have barely just begun. there is time aplenty for a beautiful story to be told.
		- and remember all of the soft, tiny, precious moments we've had yet which we wouldn't trade for anything.
- there is beauty in expansion and contraction
	- creating more and appreciating that which already is
		- deriving essence from meaning and meaning from essence and neither from itself
			- and isn't that just special? what a wonderful world we have made and find ourselves in and experience and shape and everything
- i feel bad that i have not created art
	- but i am living
		- and that is more than enough. <3
