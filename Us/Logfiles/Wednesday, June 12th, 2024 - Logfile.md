- good afternoon, library. i find myself plagued by dreams yet again.
- i dont feel like what dawn taught me is still my core belief.
	- i dont want that to be the case. there is value to both.
		- [[6over8]]
			- [[bridge]]
			- [[thoughts on archives]]
- _'luv u like a--'_
	- _'treachu like a--'_
- where do i wanna be on the scale of 0 to 1?
	- want is probably wrong. wherever i am is valuable, i think.
	- maybe its more like a scale of 1 to i, actually.
- i want to be a sweet person
	- [[theme thoughts]]
- maybe i should do some review
- i want a duck
- [[goals]]
- ![[Friday, May 31st, 2024 - Logfile#^xslzub]]
	- i really relish the thought of comparing the being that i am ten years from now to that which i am now. the only way to do so, really, is to maintain these logfiles. perhaps these should be central, then.
		- #review 
- [[project ideas]]
- wanna expand my thoughts on music and media/art consumption in general
- [x] 'k, i've been here a hot sec. i ought to work on the coding test for a Unit. .>>
	- [[Coding Test Hub]] .<<
	- Seems like this won't be too complicated to implement once I get an understanding of the underlying infrastructure. Of course, that is the hard part, as the challenge description implies, but I learn quick, so I believe I can do very well on this.
	- My next step will be to get the page loaded up just to get an overview and to have something to use the Chrome dev tools on.
- self-improvement is a [[theme thoughts|theme thought]]
- what do i wanna do with [[Spaceship You]]?
	- dunno, but i'm really liking the "get up, get ready, and go to the library" routine.
		- i can feel my attention slipping. time for a break .>>
			- feeling refreshed :) .<<
- what's on the mind?
	- family
		- i hate that they hurt me and i hate that i hurt them
		- i'm not ready to go back to them yet
	- the hab is depressingly dark
		- when we get the lease renewed, we will put in a maintenance request to get the overhead light fixed.
		- [ ] in the meantime, we can let the blinds open more frequently and use the sun lamp.
	- i'm worried about getting the coding project done in time, but i also don't wanna go home, but i need to go home for wifi.
		- maybe a walk in the park would help me feel a bit better.
			- yeah, that sounds good! let's go to the arboretum! ^~^ .>>
				- chilling at home for a bit while my phone charges :3
				- it's much different this time. there are so many people here even though it's almost 10 pm...
- y'know? i kinda don't wanna work on the coding challenge anymore today.
	- [x] instead, my work for the rest of the day will be setting myself up to do great on it tomorrow!
		- [x] Get Python set up
			- Might as well start with a simple install. I can always remove it and start fresh if needed .>>
				- Added `python3` and its `dbus` to `configuration.nix`! Hopefully that works well enough to get the WiFi up and running, but I'll have my phone with me if I need .<<
		- [x] Familiarize yourself with an outline of the process
			- I'll start with the one from ChatGPT .>>
				- Ah! It gave me a tip to get the homepage to load. That's great! .<<
		- [x] If you can, get the homepage to load
			- Let's give it a try! .>>
				- I DID IT!!!! :D .<<
- i wanna make some eggs 'n' rice! :3
	- let's do it then! .>>
		- rice is cookin' :3
			- it was yummy ^~^ .<<
- oops! reconnected to the sync and definitely duped a ton of files. that's for future clara to fix though haha[x] actually let's do that now
- i did good work today.
	- i've two days left on the project.
		- one day for debugging and another for coding. doable!
			- i might have to buy chatgpt for help, but that's just an investment in my career. lol
- luna and i are talking again :)
