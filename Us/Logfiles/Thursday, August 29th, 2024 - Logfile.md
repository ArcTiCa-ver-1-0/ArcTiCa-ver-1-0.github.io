what if i was just always working?
not like literally always, but having it be the default instead of breaks

attempted habit change to more intentional recreation failed but succeeded in the theme sense, so that's a win :)

i am so bad at moving on. i don't start for fear of hurting others or me.

anyway.
my new goal is to head home.
obviously i'm thinking about ellie.
but
being here is not the best for me.
it was valuable, though, and i learned a lot.
but it's time to head home.
- nothing doing until i get paid, though.
