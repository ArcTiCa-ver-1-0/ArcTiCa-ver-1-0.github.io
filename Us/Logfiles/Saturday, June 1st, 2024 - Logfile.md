- good afternoon, library.


- _if i was a folkstar_
	- non_diagetic_vocal-less skippy chillhop, i guess? very glowth of summer type shit. i like it.


- alright! what's doin' today?
	- [x] first i 'spose i'll check the ol' email .>>
		- both of 'em, in fact. i did in fact apply for a uk job
		- [x] nothin'. might as well check the job sites directly, too .>>
			- nothin', not unexpected.
	- [x] now, i brought this month_or_so old sticky with me. it reads "Implement Human Automation Triggers". i ought to at least think on it so i can get rid of it.
		- what am i not doin' in the mornin' that i'd like to?
			- [x] first thing to mind is i'm not settin' a timer or nothin' relative to the 'vanse. like today i got up around 9a or so and played spelunky for like four hours.
				- [x] spelunky itself might be something i consider addressing soon, but that's not the main focus right now. ^x3jrtq
				- i'd prefer to do that, chill for a Unit or so, and then get to it, starting with the easy stuff.
					- saving this as a potential next step. for now, we wait and see how [[Scratchpad - Vyvanse timer|the changes]] go.
		- [x] i'd also like to systematize environments.
			- i did well today and yesterday with my "office mode" being having the blinds open, but i'm still doing a ton of stuff in bed that i ought to not be, or at least i should be doing in a position that isn't the sleeping spot.
			- what environments do i wanna systematize?
				- office
					- the library is good because it's just a blank desk and a wall. there are no possible distractions without me getting up
					- ... other than my phone, which i just recognized i'm keeping too close to me despite the fact that it's on silent and i'm just listening to a loop. ^j9htjg
						- _gossip_, to be exact. love that brainfeel <3
					- on that note, the office definitely should not have my phone, nor should any notifications be going off. if i am in office, i want to commit to it and leave the outside world behind. it ought to be a sacred place.
				- sleep
					- i've been taking naps recently. my sleep schedule has been generally fucked, which isn't great.
						- turns out this is a common symptom of bipolar, surprise surprise :) ...is what it is `xp` | something which will naturally improve as part of my commitment to self improvement. nothing actionable in the present, nothing worth remembering in the past. let's move on. <3
					- i'm also wearing my headphones to bed, which my brain always tries to convince me helps when it is in fact obviously counterproductive and unserious.
					- maybe making the bed can be a part of this
					- given the small amount of space i have and my dearth of cozy furniture, the bed itself won't be entirely for sleep. however, i do wanna at least divide it.
						- i think keeping the soft things in the backmost corner permanently would work well (except for the issue of power cords). one orientation would thus be for sleep and the other could be configured as a chair, given that neither would interfere with the other. ^f5g2eq
				- eating...?
					- its so common for eating to go wherever. ive had vague thoughts that it might just be fine that way. ^rsovkg
					- however, it is indisputably not fine that i am watching videos while doing it when the food is palatable. if its something i like, i want light attention[^light-attention] only! ^ebo93t
			- alright, that's about all i can do from here. something to do at home!
			- ps: future self, i am aware that we will be moving away soon. it does not matter. the effort of rearranging things will still be worth it. don't let the monkey brain win this one
		- nothing else jumping straight to mind, so i'll go and do my best to action these since there's a physical item associated with them and they shouldn't take long.
	- [x] get to the [[Tasks]]! first up: sorting! .>>
	- [x] now, i've got two hours 'til close and a good bit of energy and focus left. let's do some longer stuff! .>>
		- coolio! very proud of You, babe <3 you've earned a break.
			- [x] why not watch the next episode of Murder Drones? `:3`
				- that was so tight

#
- total aside, but i dislike that `'` is treated like an enclosing markdown character in that when i start a word with one, i have to delete the one automatically put at the end.
- [x] [[Tasks]].add ^ .>>
	- [x] get the copy link plugin .>>

- [x] get the list item manager plugin .>>
#
- ![[Scratchpad - Vyvanse timer#^phase]]
	- unsure on this term, Phase.

- what does the Done folder mean? should i move Logfiles into there ever? should it be a tag?
	- tag organization is so frustrating. ... but i won't let that stop me. i'm positive there's a plugin to help <3

[^light-attention]: a set which does not include video or podcasts but might include music

- already here an hour...! time flies when you're properly medicated. and i've been working the whole time! so proud of Us <3

- i can feel my brain is kinda slippery rn. i don't know if its the worst.
- another momentum thought, i guess. when i'm all wound up i can store real high-level stuff, but it's inevitable that i overthink the simple things then, leading to frustration.

- i continue to enjoy having the graph open on the right. although, i might move it to the left, below the active small section.
- oh yeah, that's the right choice. very like.

- [ ] review [[Review of the first two Logfiles]]

- maybe i review once a week or somethin'. today's saturday, so sure, what the heck. saturday is now my review day.
- [x] formalize it
___
- hello again, library. i am back from my break. i feel a bit out of it, almost in a psychosis way.
- speaking of, i've thankfully both been experiencing it less recently and have not stopped experiencing it completely. i'm not sure why i like the feeling of holding on to what i can only name as delusions. i guess it makes things feel meaningful, somehow. and maybe a tiny bit like everything will be okay.
- were they gone, i'd be left with experiences and sensations inexplicable except by diagnostic naming.
- the fact that it touches on the unknowable... and the fact that i _know_ it is unknowable... it's shocking that doesn't bother me. it almost makes me happy.
- ...
- brains lie to us to make things seem consistent. there is proof of this on scales large and small.
- i wonder just how much they can do, and if what i've been seeing are cracks in the facade, bits of incomprehensibility lurking behind.
- ...

- [x] i ought to apply to at least one job today.
	- [x] it would be helpful if i set up my Work Vault first.
- very halfhearted, but it was for a position that i don't actually want, and i did it, regardless.

- what ought i do at 4:18 on a saturday?
- i ought to be working at home, i think. let's head there. .>>
